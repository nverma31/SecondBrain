Once again, meeting *old friends* allowed me to see that old side of me that has been lurking behind since ages. Realised that I can still have *unbridled fun* and has the capacity to let go. All this was accompanied by A sense of belonging and being yourself- whatever that is.
However, it also brought the *feeing of missing out or staying behind, and questioning your own decision making* - all to human emotions.
Importantly, the lack of finances and assets. It's not that I would like to earn more but it is more like having a plan for retirement. Of course, I don't want to retire at an early age, but I would like to increase my agency in choosing what and how I do things. 
Another realisation is the constant urge to *be holier than thou positions* and the need to act as in you are an expert. How can I control this while still having discussion tending to give and take.
Afterwards *Loneliness* crept back in as everyone left and I was in a hotel room by myself. since  moving back and forth from India to German in the last 1,5 years this was pushed way deeper and I forgot how it feels to be alone. Although I crave being by myself to be able to achieve things that I have deemed necessary. Suddenly, being alone in the hotel room made me realise the importance of companionship and having a partner, even though that comes with a severe curtailment of your own freedom and ambitions. Clearly, today I feel that being around people is way more important than solitude(a quality cherished by intellectuals I have been listening to recently). Well, just the fact that I'm writing down my thoughts which is something I aspire to do underlines that. But, that feeling of being one with the group and laughing and joking still is more desirable. 
This brings us to the paradoxical nature of being a human where you seemingly crave opposite situations, emotions, and things at the same time. Moreover, this multitudal existence is our bane as well as our liberation.
