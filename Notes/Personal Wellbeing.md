18. First, using the resistive band, put one end in the door and close it tight. Wrap the band around either leg. You will do the exercises on both legs. The leg that has the band on it is working dynamically or with movement, and the other leg is working statically to keep you stable. You will keep your leg straight and try not to bend your knee. Pull your leg across your body into hip adduction. Next, you are going to lie down on your back with your knees propped up in a hooklying position. Take a thick pillow or ball and place it between your knees. Squeeze into the ball or pillow and hold for 3-5 seconds. Finally, you will lie on your side with the leg you want to work on the ground. Keep your body in a straight line, and bend your top leg in front of or behind the bottom leg. Keep the bottom leg straight and try not to bend your knee. Lift your leg off the ground only about 4-6 inches. Start with 10-15 and work your way up. If you have ankle weights, you can add those when it becomes easy.
