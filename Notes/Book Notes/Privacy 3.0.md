**PROLOGUE: The Year Aadhaar Exploded** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 29** 

The government had already made Aadhaar linkage mandatory to avail of certain schemes run through the Public Distribution System (PDS) and the LPG distribution scheme. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 43** 

But even as enthusiasm for Aadhaar was growing, opposition to it rose to a crescendo. Activists, lawyers and politicians of every hue demanded the cancellation of the project, **calling into question the technology, the fact that it had been implemented without legislative backing, and that rather than providing benefits to the poor it was resulting in exclusion. **

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 46** 

They claimed that the sinister motive behind linking anything and everything to the Aadhaar database was the **creation of a giant panopticon to watch over us and monitor our every move**. There was a real fear that we had already slipped into an Orwellian dystopia where the State has a record of everything we do, where we 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 61** 

**Opposition against Aadhaar was largely focused on the privacy implications of the project. It might have been a bit more muted if we actually had in place a full-fledged privacy law.** Or if somewhere in our judicial history we had recognised personal privacy as needing protection under the law. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 63** 

**Not only were we among the very few countries in the world that did not have a privacy law,** a few years previously, while defending the Aadhaar project, the attorney general of the country had argued that India had no such thing as a fundamental right to privacy. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 74** 

But technology rarely heeds to legal restrictions. Innovation has always proceeded apace despite the attempts of the law to restrain it. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 84** 

came to realise that **privacy has passed through three distinct phases of evolution.** In the first stage of 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 85** 

privacy we developed, for **the first time, the idea of personal space and private thoughts. We evolved laws that were designed to protect information that we disclosed to others in confidence, allowing us recourse against those who betrayed our trust**. But as technology developed, this approach was not nearly sufficient to protect our personal privacy. We needed protection from those beyond our immediate circle of trust as technology made it possible for complete strangers to invade our personal space. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 88** 

**Privacy 2.0 was about elevating it to the status of a right that could be exercised against anyone who impinged upon our privacy without our express consent.** This is the construct upon which most of our laws have been based and on which we have relied for years to protect us. It has served us well from the time when data about us was kept in physical files all the way to the dawn of the internet when everything began to be digitised. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 91** 

We stand at the threshold of Privacy 3.0. Our world today is so rich with data that the consent-based protection that has served us well for so many decades is proving ineffective against the onslaught of modern technologies. 

**1 Naturally Private?** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 142** 

Solitude is a luxury enjoyed by only those few animals who occupy a position on the top of the food chain. Everyone else needs to form alliances with other members of their species so they can live together and get to live a little longer. As a concept, **solitude and, consequently, privacy is utterly alien to nature,** so how did human beings evolve and cleave to it so strongly that they now universally accept it as being so fundamental to the very notion of humanity as to be above the written law? 

**2 In the Fish Bowl** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 191** 

Now that they had permanent homes, their enemies and predators knew where to go to find them. The entire tribe still depended on every single member pulling his weight, and it was more dangerous than ever to keep secrets. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 216** 

For a system like this to work, no one could have any personal space. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 225** 

Nearly all the anthropological studies of early human tribes describe similar behaviour. Early societies not only had no concept of privacy, they were, on the other hand, organised to ensure the free flow of personal information between members of the tribe. The 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 240** 

As a result, everyone was constantly under pressure to be on their best behaviour, knowing that any slip would result in ridicule or, worse, castigation and excommunication. The tension began to tell and conflicts among members of the tribe began to grow. Unlike in their nomadic past, when irreconcilable 

**3 What Walls Did** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 272** 

**This opportunity to escape from the constraints of conformity gave rise to a freedom of thought and action that had previously never existed. **

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 279** 

Once this happened, **people were able to develop two distinct personas**–one for public consumption that they displayed when they were out and about in the world, and the other that they only allowed to surface within the confines of their home when they were in the company of those they trusted. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 290** 

**It is in the evolution of this split personality that our modern notion of privacy is rooted**. As long as man lived his entire life in the public gaze, there was no need for privacy. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 311** 

Even in these societies, privacy was not a luxury that was available to the poor. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 323** 

In time, these concepts of seclusion and privacy began to permeate all Western religious practices. 

**4 A Creature of Technology** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 346** 

**Privacy was created by man. This zone of privacy is the place from which art and science, as we know them, developed. It was the basis of our cultural norms and the philosophical thoughts and values that define us. It allowed us to unlock our creativity, freeing us up to create works of art without fear of judgment or ridicule. **

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 353** 

**Technology has, time and again, butted heads with privacy, forcing us to constantly re-draw the boundaries of what we had previously believed to be our personal space. 
**
**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 367** 

**No technology has ever been shut down because of the privacy threat that it posed to the existing social order. 
**
**5 Confidences** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 373** 

Once religion gave substance to the understanding that it was perfectly acceptable to keep confidences from one another, the principles of confidentiality took firm root in our dealings with each other. Various professions borrowed these notions 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 376** 

Doctors assured their patients of confidentiality to 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 378** 

attorney-client privilege 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 381** 

These principles began to insinuate themselves into the law, and eventually common law began to recognise a duty of non-disclosure in the context of fiduciary relationships and commercial contract. As best as we can ascertain, the first mention of private rights was made by English jurist William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765). The law, he said, has ‘so particular and tender a regard to the immunity of a man’s house that it stiles it his castle, and will never suffer it to be violated with impunity’.1 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 410** 

The **world’s first copyright law–the Statute of Anne–had just been passed and, in the early 1700s, intellectual property as a concept was at its infancy**. Even 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 448** 

This was the first of many cases that would pit the need for individual privacy against the desire to avail the benefits that this new technology could bring. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 475** 

With this, privacy was finally given the status of a right by the courts. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 491** 

The evolution of jurisprudence in England revolved around privacy violations that came about as a consequence of a breach of trust and reliance on trusted relationships. As a result, the law, as it developed in the UK, was designed to protect an individual against betrayal by confidants. It did not require the existence of a formal contract but did require demonstration of a relationship of confidentiality. 

**6 The Right** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 528** 

All of this created a new and particularly intrusive type of press corps that was armed with powerful new technologies and empowered by the protections guaranteed to them by the First Amendment in the American Constitution. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 552** 

in 1890, was simply entitled ‘The Right to Privacy’ but has been called the ‘most influential law review article of all’6 and an ‘outstanding example of the influence of legal periodicals upon the American law’.7 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 555** 

Roscoe Pound, an eminent jurist in his own right, said that it did ‘nothing less than add a chapter to our law’.8 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 603** 

Many jurists have since written that his concept articulated a right to personal space without being able to properly express it in terms that would be relevant in the context of modern technology. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 610** 

in 1890, you wanted an injunction from an American court, there was almost no way in which you could obtain it unless you could prove an injury to property. Which meant that if someone’s personal affairs–including those of a deviant homosexual brother–were about to be made public by a newspaper, there may not have been any real cause of action for an injunction. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 613** 

articulate a right to privacy against the press was because of the almost unbridled freedom that was guaranteed to them under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. In the words of Justice Cooley: 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 630** 

They were particularly concerned about the extent to which these new technologies were beginning to exacerbate the already considerable intrusiveness of the press. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 638** 

**a jurisprudence that is based on the notions of confidentiality requires the existence of some sort of a relationship between the parties. No such relationship could be established when privacy was being invaded by strangers equipped with cameras who had no connection whatsoever with the subject of the photograph. **

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 674** 

they argued, the individual needed some way to exercise his right to be left alone against the world–as a right in rem. Accordingly, the principle that they felt should be applied to protect personal writings and any other similar productions was the right to privacy–the right that every private individual has to protect himself from portraiture, or to protect discussions about his private affairs from being shared with the public. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 695** 

The people of New York were no longer willing to meekly tolerate the interference by the press into their personal affairs. This was, in many ways, the United States’ ‘Aadhaar’ moment. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 697** 

The resulting outcry led directly to the enactment of a law that made the use of a person’s name, portrait or likeness without their consent a misdemeanour. Eventually, several other states enacted similar laws, firmly bringing the concept of privacy into the statute books. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 742** 

As a result, the concepts set out in the article gained wide acceptance. They offered courts a new way to think about privacy, taking it outside the realm of confidentiality as it had existed till this time and allowed them to create a right where none previously existed. 

**7 The Currency of Information** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 795** 

Eventually, bowing to the pressure from a concerted opposition, the legislatures of various states of the Union passed laws that prohibited the disclosure of telegraph messages–along much the same lines as they had previously prevented the reading of postal messages. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 797** 

**fact that the government has the power to take control of our personal communications has built up in us an innate distrust of the state and the government machinery. The ability to intercept communications remains, to this day, one of the prerogatives of the state and an example of some of the most egregious violations 
**
**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 799** 

of personal privacy of the modern day. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 847** 

However, in order to stand out among the competition, credit rating businesses began to collect more and more information about the individuals they assessed–information that, while not directly financially relevant, was nevertheless indicative of their ability to pay. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 862** 

Now, every time any sort of personal data was collected from an individual, consent was obtained through standard form language describing a set of purposes broad enough to cover all possible uses to which that data could be put. Most customers didn’t think twice about the consequences of providing that consent, incapable of appreciating how parting with this data could affect their personal privacy. But each item of data they provided eventually found its way into the hands of credit rating agencies, that added every little nugget of information they could gather to the information they already had, improving and refining the profiles they were building. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 866** 

When computers and networked databases began to insinuate themselves into commercial life, the volume of information that these organisations could collect and process increased exponentially. **With greater data storage capacity, more and more details about a person’s life could be stored–until these agencies had almost as much information about the people they were tracking as they did themselves. With the improvement in processing power and advanced computation technologies at their disposal, these companies began to identify patterns in the data that had until then remained unseen, offering further novel insights into the people they were profiling. Credit rating agencies today control some of the most detailed databases of personal information on the planet. 
**
**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 905** 

Tappan’s design choice continues to affect the way data is collected and processed. Since he first started issuing credit ratings, the scope of the business expanded beyond merely providing credit information to helping businesses develop various personalisation tools that allow them to tailor their services to more specifically suit our personal preferences. **As a result of that design choice, a tremendous asymmetry has developed **

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 924** 

But as much as these jurisdictions have had decades of experience regulating personal data, the approach that they follow when it comes to matters of data protection is heavily influenced by Lewis Tappan’s original design. This 

**8 Meanwhile, in India...** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 941** 

It is this fundamental difference in India’s exposure to the personal consequences of the deprivation of privacy that has given rise until recently to our laissez-faire attitude to the technologies that clearly have an effect on our personal liberty. It is the reason why the Indian government was able to, virtually without objection, conceptualise, create and implement a project as ambitious in scope as Aadhaar, where elsewhere in the world similar projects have come to a standstill. In many ways, Aadhaar was the first technological shift that has had a direct impact on personal privacy that we have felt for ourselves in India. As much as we might be outraged by it, we have to appreciate that this reaction is no different from opposition to technologies that have come before it–the portable camera and the telegraph. 

**9 Early Thoughts on Privacy** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 967** 

After all, India has been an advanced, highly civilised society for millennia. It stands to reason that if, when other nation-states evolved from hunter-gatherers into city dwellers they adopted notions of privacy in the process, India too must have done so in similar fashion. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 969** 

But since we never experienced any of the technology-driven changes that Western societies have gone through, we have never felt the same visceral opposition to its impact in the way that other nations have. Probably the very first time we ever had to think about these issues as a nation was after we had shrugged off colonial rule and were sitting down to write ourselves a Constitution. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 980** 

And yet, when the Constitution of India was adopted with much fanfare on 26 January 1950, it contained no mention of the right to privacy. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1030** 

By articulating a fundamental right to the secrecy of correspondence and against unreasonable search and seizure, the framers of the Constitution were attempting to accord constitutional protection to the concept of privacy as it was then understood to exist. Right from the start, there were strong voices of dissent against the inclusion of these provisions in the Constitution. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1064** 

As a result, the latter came away convinced that the inclusion of an obligation to follow the high standards of due process would impose an undue burden on the newly formed Indian judiciary. Immediately following his return to India, B.N. Rau promptly redrafted Article 21 of the Constitution of India to exclude all reference to the concept of due process. This line of thinking also affected the way he thought about privacy as an offshoot of personal liberty and was probably the reason why he opposed its inclusion as a fundamental right in the Constitution. According to him, such a right could place impediments in the way of law enforcement, particularly given the fact that India was a large country where the administration of criminal justice was bound to be difficult: 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1082** 

**Today we worry far less that criminals will invoke their right to privacy and use it to escape prosecution. We are far more concerned about the ways in which the government can violate the privacy of its citizens if it is not fettered by the constraints that would have been imposed on them had we had a fundamental right to privacy. It seems, with the benefit of hindsight, that while trying to arrive at a balance between the interest of the individual and the objectives of the state, B.N. Rau might have tipped the balance too far in the direction of the state. 
**
**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1091** 

Their experience of dealing first-hand with the many challenges that came with governance had left them with a strong conviction that it was far more important to vest in the state adequate power to deal with issues of law and order than to equip the individual with a right to protect himself against state overreach. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1099** 

Time, it seems, does little to change the thrust of these paternalistic arguments. 

**10 Privacy in the Indian Courts** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1125** 

It was a literal statement reflecting the fact that the Chapter on Fundamental Rights does not explicitly list a fundamental right to privacy. But it would eventually be made to assume much greater significance. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1149** 

This was a powerful opinion, one that articulated an implicit right to privacy even though no such right was explicitly listed. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1189** 

**Of course, privacy primarily concerns the individual. It therefore relates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty. The most serious advocate of privacy must confess that there are serious problems of defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in autonomy must also be placed in the context of other rights and values. 
**
**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1203** 

Over the next forty years, a solid jurisprudence of privacy was built up within the country, Indian courts silently developing case law affirming the right to privacy despite the fact that its Constitution was silent on the principle. These cases touched upon a wide variety of subjects, ranging from the rights of the press to medical privacy. In every one of them, the judges relied on the decisions in these three foundational cases–and particularly on the conclusion arrived at in Govind. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1218** 

****zb**The Supreme Court first made it clear8 that the freedom of press cannot interfere with an individual’s right to personal privacy. It said that privacy, which was originally protected under the law of torts, had since acquired constitutional status under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and now guaranteed every citizen, even criminals, the right to be left alone and to safeguard his own privacy as well as that of his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education. But, having said that, there were exceptions to the rule such as if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy. So

the opinion of the court, the press, as the fourth pillar of the state, performed a vital public function and was therefore covered under the ambit of Article 226 of the Constitution of India. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1265** 

Among the many complex issues that need to be addressed in the context of the matrimonial h****ome is the right to privacy in the context of medical health. Given the close personal relationship that a husband and wife share, the ill health of one often affects the other. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1291** 

There has been a conflict between personal privacy and criminal justice since the very beginning of the development of our privacy jurisprudence. Those very early cases were all about excessive surveillance by law enforcement authorities. In time, the questions that had to be addressed by the court came to revolve around the use of new technologies. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1372** 

Their rights are not ‘so-called’ but are real rights founded on sound constitutional doctrine. They inhere in the right to life. They dwell in privacy and dignity. They constitute the essence of liberty and freedom. Sexual orientation is an essential component of identity. Equal protection demands protection of the identity of every individual 

**11 Identity and Privacy** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1413** 

The reason for this is our deep history of fundamental mistrust of the government. None of the various processes by which these identity cards were issued is seen to be truly dependable. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1423** 

**In India, our identity lies at the intersection of multiple identity documents. We are the composite of the various government services that we avail of. In many ways, this multiplicity of identities is our primary line of defence against identity theft in the absence of a formal law. Since 
**
**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1428** 

The fact that government databases are maintained in silos, incapable of speaking with each other, and that the proof of identity that they issue is universally mistrusted is what has kept us safe for all these years in the absence of a privacy law. 

**12 A New Privacy Law** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1523** 

For years, the lack of a privacy law hadn’t bothered us because the databases that contain our personal information are silos, incapable of speaking to one another. Our privacy has been protected over all these years by this plurality of personal information, and the fact that it is impossible to build any sort of personal profile of an Indian is because no common data architecture exists to link our identity. Aadhaar, as I explained to Nandan, had the ability to strip away that protection. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1560** 

These were the sorts of insights that were critical to the process of preparing a law. Each country needs to arrive at a balance between its many priorities and, as with every other facet of social conduct, privacy is a balance between competing social interests. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1562** 

Every now and then, as we have seen, in response to changes in technology, this line gets redrawn and society has to re-adjust to new boundaries. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1615** 

The cornerstone of every single piece of legislation that we studied was the principle of consent. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1636** 

From my experience with companies that operated in Europe, the procedural requirements under European data protection law were so cumbersome that companies had to invest significant resources in compliance. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1639** 

One such innovation that ultimately found its way into the draft law was the concept of a National Data Controller Registry. Most privacy laws around the world require data collectors to state upfront the purpose for which they are collecting data and how they intend to use it. The reason for this is to let data subjects know what their data is being used for. That information is usually listed in the privacy policy that the data subject signs up to. Which means that if you want to know what data is being collected from you and how it is being used, your only option is to scroll through every single privacy policy that you have ever signed up to in order to determine what information each of those various data collectors is collecting from you. In an attempt to simplify this, we decided to create an online portal where the data controllers were obliged to list the data they were collecting and had under their control, and the purposes for which they were intending to use it. It was our intention to make this portal searchable so that important information pertaining to an individual’s personal data could be made more readily accessible if required. With that, if anyone was concerned as to how their data was being used, they could access the National Data Controller Registry and search the database for that controller and find out all the different ways in which they were processing personal data. This was a novel concept and one that we believed was not particularly onerous to implement. The idea was to try and develop a privacy law that was an evolution of what had existed until then, and less than a decade later I would see strains of this idea reflected in the concept of the consent dashboard that the Justice B.N. Srikrishna Committee would suggest in its white paper on the subject. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1658** 

The rules were called the Information Technology Act (Reasonable 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1663** 

The Privacy Rules, as I eventually came to call them, contained just eight rules, the first three of which were definitions and other statutory formalities, leaving just five substantive provisions. Within these narrow constraints, the Privacy Rules covered the full range of privacy provisions that one would have ordinarily expected to find in a full-blown statute. It required all bodies corporate that dealt with personal information to publish a privacy policy that stated how they intended to deal with the personal information in their control. There were regulations around the collection of personal information and the requirement for prior written consent. There were restrictions on the collection of information that was not necessary for the stated purpose and the requirement that information was not to be retained for longer than was necessary to achieve the stated purpose. Data subjects were allowed to withdraw consent at any time and the data controller had to take steps to allow the data subject to verify and correct his information as and when required. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1676** 

What was even more galling was the fact that, while the legislative process was fraught with the sorts of checks and balances that is normal in a functioning democracy, the executive seemed to be able to enact a regulation on the same subject matter with hardly any effort at all. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1696** 

the best of my knowledge, the Privacy Rules have never been challenged. As a result, they operated as the de facto privacy regulation of the country even though they had never gone through a formal legislative process. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1724** 

Additionally, it was my belief that concepts like surveillance and interception of communications did not fit into the overall scheme of a data protection legislation which was designed to address issues of personal and sensitive personal data. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1748** 

The Shah Committee went on to stipulate that choice and consent were essential elements of the law and data controllers should only collect, process, use or disclose personal information to third parties with the consent of the data subject. Where information is required, by law, to be provided, it should be collected in compliance with the other privacy principles and should be anonymised within a reasonable timeframe if published in public databases. The Committee believed that the data subject should, at any time, have the power to withdraw consent. 

**13 The Puttaswamy Judgment** 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1841** 

Once Aadhaar became ubiquitous, the fear was that the government would, with minimal effort, be able to reach across its disparate databases and connect the scattered information about individuals, thereby allowing the government, for the first time, to build a rich, complete picture of their activities. As Malavika Jayaram from the Berkman Klein Centre wrote: ‘We should worry about the detailed profiles that it helps create, the complex patterns it reveals when combined with other data, however innocuous, and the social sorting that it enables. Not least because information asymmetries result in the data subject becoming a data object, to be manipulated, misrepresented and policed at will.’3 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1900** 

Privacy, in its simplest sense, allows each human being to be left alone in a core which is inviolable. Yet the autonomy of the individual is conditioned by her relationships with the rest of society. Those relationships may and do often pose questions to autonomy and free choice. The overarching presence of state and non-state entities regulates aspects of social existence which bear upon the freedom of the individual. The preservation of constitutional liberty is, so to speak, work in progress. Challenges have to be addressed to existing problems. Equally, new challenges have to be dealt with in terms of a constitutional understanding of where liberty places an individual in the context of a social order. The emergence of new challenges is exemplified by this case, where the debate on privacy is being analysed in the context of a global information-based society. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1931** 

Privacy is a constitutionally protected right which emerges primarily from the guarantee of life and personal liberty in Article 21 of the Constitution. Elements of privacy also arise in varying contexts from the other facets of freedom and dignity recognised and guaranteed by the fundamental rights contained in Part III. That said, he recognised that, as with all rights, the right to privacy is not an unfettered or absolute right. To

This state of flux which represents a constant evolution of individual personhood in the relationship with the rest of society provides the rationale for reserving to the individual a zone 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 1992** 

creation of such a regime requires a careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate concerns of the state. The legitimate aims of the state would include for instance protecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits. These are matters of policy to be considered by the Union government while designing a carefully structured regime for the protection of the data. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2018** 

Modern society, he said, is a form of collective existence that imposes duties and obligations on individuals towards the society of which they are a part. Our ‘right to be’ has always been circumscribed by societal norms but of late is being further affected by technology. Individuals are at risk that the data that has been collected about them will be used by social networks, search engines, e-mail service providers, messaging applications that already have extensive knowledge of their movements, financial transactions, conversations, health, mental state, interest, travel locations, fares and shopping habits. This sort of knowledge about a person can be used to influence his decision-making processes and shape his behaviour. He called for the formulation of a data protection law that balanced privacy concerns with legitimate state interests. He made reference to the Justice B.N. Srikrishna Committee that had been appointed to identify key data protection issues in India and recommend methods of addressing them. He hoped, as I did, that this would finally lead to the formulation of a privacy law. The nine judges of the Supreme Court had convened to redress an ancient anomaly in our jurisprudence. After unequivocally establishing that even though it wasn’t written into our Constitution, we did in fact have a fundamental right to privacy, they used the unique opportunity of having nine wise men assembled together in one place to reflect on the challenges that lay before us. They recognised that, in order to benefit from all that the modern data-driven world has to offer, we would need to place some fetters on the right to privacy to which we are entitled. None of their observations were Luddite in character; to the contrary, they seemed to recognise that technology could–and should–be used to improve our lives and benefit the less fortunate in ways that might not be possible without technology. At the same time, they seemed to be mindful of the fact that all of this is easier said than done. The unintended consequences of blindly adopting modern data techniques could be devastating–to the individual and to society. While predictive algorithms can be remarkably prescient in many of the determinations they make, they can equally be surprisingly blind to nuances of human interactions in a complex society. It is here that a new balance needs to be struck–one that needs to ensure that the ends of governance and societal benefits are achieved without the human and social costs that would come from thoughtlessly implementing new technologies. We have to learn how to take full advantage of these powerful new technologies without, in the process, eroding our personal privacy.

But just as these sorts of flow-based lending algorithms can bring people into the financial system, they can just as quickly forever exclude them from

If India chooses to use consent to protect itself against privacy violations, it could well forgo the benefits of innovation and, at the same time, find it very hard to protect its people against the harms that could be caused to them 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2135** 

transfers of data, interconnections between multiple health information systems, and the use of big data analytics need to pass through the gateway of consent before they can be implemented. However, relying too heavily on consent as a safeguard against privacy violations is, in itself, a concern. When you examine the way it operates, consent neither offers the level of protection that transactions in sensitive personal data deserve nor does it provide the flexibility that these new data technologies need in order to scale and grow. 

**15 A New Framework for Privacy**

Most specify that mere consent is not enough–it must be informed consent. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2165** 

Consent, therefore, serves two purposes. On the one hand, it gives the data subject autonomy over the use of his personal data, giving him the absolute power to decide whether or not to allow it to be used. On the other, once consent has been properly obtained, it indemnifies the data controller from any violations of privacy or other harm that results from the use of that personal data.

Today, data is collected, processed, transferred and consumed in too many ways to comprehensively enumerate. Our social activity is logged, parsed and analysed, our shopping habits observed and personal preferences tracked. Every financial transaction that we undertake is recorded somewhere and often correlated against location, age, time of day and a host of other parameters that we are unaware of. The wearable devices we use to measure personal parameters like fitness and health continuously collect personal data from us, storing this information on servers in the cloud in formats that are easily processed by other service providers who use this information in connection with other data to generate valuable insights about our health and activities. In our daily lives, we constantly engage with sensors, not just those on our fitness trackers, but also those in the smart speakers that listen to everything we say and in our phones that we keep on our person at all times, allowing them to record, along with a multitude of

a result, none of the services that have been daisy-chained together in that long workflow has any responsibility whatsoever for the consequences of its joint actions. Each one hands over responsibility down the chain so that at no point in time can any service provider be responsible for the actions of all of them in concert.

less. When individual elements of non-personal data are combined together, it is possible that, by combining this innocuous data, unique profiles of the individuals they relate to can emerge–patterns that reveal insights from data that was otherwise completely unremarkable. Computers 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2264** 

As a result, information that was originally non-personal is rapidly being transformed into personal sensitive information. Given the way that privacy laws are designed, as long as no personal information is being collected, there is no legal requirement to seek consent. As a result, there are no legal fetters to the use of this data or the processing of it. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2286** 

This hardly seems appropriate. How can a data subject be expected to be held to the consent he has provided when it is impossible for him to fully understand the implications of giving such consent. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2293** 

It is the data controller, therefore, that is best placed to appreciate the impact that collection and processing of data can have on the data subject. Surely it makes sense to shift the responsibility of ensuring the personal privacy away from the data subject and to the data controller. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2310** 

The accountability model will impose a penalty on the data controller in the event a privacy breach occurs. In order for a company to be truly accountable for ensuring privacy, it would need to be liable to suffer the consequences of failing to protect the personal privacy of the individual. Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the world’s latest data protection legislation, a penalty of as much as 4 per cent of global turnover has been suggested for privacy violations. Something along these lines would have the necessary deterrent value to ensure that data controllers take their responsibilities seriously. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2314** 

That said, the trouble with introducing heavy penalties into the privacy regime is that it is likely to have the unintended consequence of making data controllers excessively cautious in their approach. While caution is always a good thing when dealing with large volumes of personal data, it could operate as an unnecessary restraint on useful innovation. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2317** 

In the current context, the balance that needs to be achieved is between protecting individual privacy and freeing up data to properly inform our decision making. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2321** 

One way to achieve this is to ensure that the regulatory focus is on remediation rather than on punishment. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2328** 

Instead of punishing data controllers for inadvertent errors in their algorithms or in their data processes, the emphasis should be on encouraging the data controller to remediate in a timely fashion. They should only be penalised if, after they become or are made aware of a privacy violation, they fail to remedy it in time. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2332** 

At all times, they should be required to design their data systems to enhance the privacy of their customers and to enable data subjects to apply techniques such as de-identification and data minimisation wherever possible, as the less personal data that is out there, the lower is the risk of harm. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2340** 

However, even with the best intentions, it is possible that design flaws could slip through. To safeguard against this, the model needs to additionally include a construct by which data processes can be independently verified to assess whether any faulty processes that might have escaped the scrutiny of the data controller are influencing the outcomes. The easiest way to implement this would be through an audit. Most privacy laws around the work require data controllers to carry out data protection impact assessments (DPIA) every time they roll out a new technology. These assessments are designed to evaluate the harm that is likely to occur from the implementation of a new technology. However, it is usually the data controller itself that is responsible for implementing the DPIA and, given that it is in the interests of the data controller to ensure that the impact assessment is positive, this may not be an entirely effective check. Other privacy laws make the data protection authority responsible for conducting audits. While this achieves the objective of an independent third party audit, I fear that the woeful lack of state capacity in India will make this ineffective in the Indian context. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2354** 

They will perform the role that financial auditors do today–except that instead of financial affairs, they will audit the data practices of the data controllers. 

**Highlight(****yellow****) - Location 2358** 

In time, I can see these intermediaries begin to rate data controllers for their data practices, offering the equivalent of triple A ratings for data controllers that follow high standards of data protection and lower ratings for those who do not. In time, as awareness of the implications of personal privacy increases, companies will be able to attract customers to their services on the basis of the quality of their data practices.
