### notes
Monogamous, arranged, heterosexual and same-community marriages are idealised - more than 90% of all marriages in India are arranged. Interfaith marriages are rare. One study put them at just over 2%. Many believe the spectre of love jihad is resurrected from time to time by Hindu groups for political gains.
That such strident campaigns against interfaith unions have a long and chequered history in India is well-documented.
In the backdrop of rising religious tensions in the 1920s and 1930s, Hindu nationalist groups in parts of northern India launched a campaign against "kidnapping" of Hindu women by Muslim men and demanded the recovery of their Hindu wives.



### Final Article: Secular or Commun

As my single life is soon ending, I was looking up ways to get legally married in India. I dicovered that the marriage laws are highly communal in nature, and the only secular provision — the special marriage act — is designed in a way that leaves room for the others to contest and possibly stop the marriage . This initially surprised me  but soon I came to realise that the laws are just the reflection of our conservative society.

Let's first take a look at how can one get legally married in India. All of the laws except one are faith based such as Hindu Marriage Act 1955, Muslim Marriage Registration Act 1981, Anand Marriage Act for Sikhs, Christian Marriage Act 1872, and Parsi Marriage and Divorce act of 1936. Unlike these laws, the Special Marriage Act, 1954 allows for both inter-religious and inter-caste marriages.

As per the Special marriage act, a public notice needs to be given to the sub-registrar of the territorial jurisdiction where either of the parties reside or live. This public notice will be displayed in sub-registrar's office for a minimum period of 1 month. Finally, only in case there is no "reasonable" objection as decided by the marriage officer, the marriage can be solemnized. Besides the fact that it is an unnecessary complicated and painful process, it  is vague in terms of what counts as an unreasonable or reasonable objection. Infact, two consenting adult who intend to marry, requiring to put up a public notice for 30 days is downright an infringement of their freedom and privacy.

I believe that these laws reflect the conservative nature and highly religious nature of Indian  society. More than 90% of marriages in India are arranged, and mostly among the same caste and religion. Only over 2% of marriages are interfaith. According to a pew research survey, roughly two-third Hindu's says it is very important to stop Hindu women or Hindu men from marrying into other religious communities. Even larger shares of Muslims oppose interreligious marriage: 80% say it is very important to stop Muslim women from marrying outside their religion, and 76% say it is very important to stop Muslim men from doing so. Special marriage act, only which legalises interfaith marriage, with it's 30 days public notice makes couple live in fear of reprisals throughout that period.

Moreover, the current social and political climate points to a downward trajectory for interfaith marriages . In November 2020, Uttar Pradesh passed a law, Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, which bans "unlawful conversion" by force, fraudulent means or marriage. It was in response to a ridiculous baseless conspiracy theory that Muslim men are seducing Hindu women with the sole purpose of converting them to Islam. Several people have already been arrested under this law, and other states are also planning to enact on similar laws. 

Having a secular marriage law which involves nothing more than the consent of the individuals and no public notice would definitely be a start, however, the society needs to more tolerant and secular before we see any rise in interfaith marriages. Starting with the constitution, a lot of laws in our country tries to enforce a liberal values in an illiberal Indian Society, however, the marriage laws in India are a reflection of society.
