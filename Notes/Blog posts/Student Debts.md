Monogamous, arranged, heterosexual and same-community marriages are idealised - more than 90% of all marriages in India are arranged. Interfaith marriages are rare. One study put them at just over 2%. Many believe the spectre of love jihad is resurrected from time to time by Hindu groups for political gains.
That such strident campaigns against interfaith unions have a long and chequered history in India is well-documented.
In the backdrop of rising religious tensions in the 1920s and 1930s, Hindu nationalist groups in parts of northern India launched a campaign against "kidnapping" of Hindu women by Muslim men and demanded the recovery of their Hindu wives.

### Final Article: Secular or Commun

As someone who studied in the US and  understand the pain of student loans, reading about Biden administration student loan relief plan certainly aroused my curiosity. Whether Biden administration  will succeed in enacting a student loan relief program is still uncertain, I want to look closely at it from a public policy perspective.

According to Federal Reserve estimated Americans currently have a student debt of $1.73 trillion. To put that in perspective, it more than half of India's current GDP. This is 3% more than 2020 even though Biden adminstration have eliminated roughly $10 billion since taking office.  Biden has endorsed canceling $10,000 in  student debt, which is currently held by more than 43 million borrowers, but some Democratic leaders are asking for up to $50,000.

There seems to be compelling moral arguments favoring student debt cancellation. Student debt disproportionately affects the financially disadvantages communities and reaffirms exisiting inequalities. Low-income students, first-generation students and Black students find it harder to repay thier loans About 70% of those in default are first-generation students, and 40% come from low-income backgrounds. While white stuents after twenty years are able to pay their debt in 94% of the cases, only 5% Black students have been able to repay. Moreover, many recent college grads are facing physical and mental health problem causes by financial distress, which lasts for years. On the other hand, some feels that debt cancellation will create a moral hazard, as students will no longer make careful decisions as other are expected to cover their risks. Ultimately, in my opinion the moral benefits outweighs the moral hazard argument, which can be mitigated with appropriate strategies. 

Looking at it from an economic reasoning perspective, under the assumption that government should mostly address market failure. Let's start by looking at the market failures of higher education in America. First, there exists an information asymmetry as a student will never know how good their college is and how their degree will affect their job prospects until after they finish the college. Second, there are  positive externalities from higher education to the society in many ways. Therefore, I believe that government's debt cancellation is justified as it aims to address these market failures.
There are others who talk about the short-sightedness of the debt cancelation program and point to the fact that there is a need to reform and regulate the educational institutes who are responsible for higher unaffordable fees. However, such meddling would surely have many unintendend consequences including a decrease in demand of these higher degrees and possibly the quality of education itself. 

Therefore, the government should constraint themselves in financially supporting the individual rathen than regualting educational institutions seems like right approach going forward. And, with the moral implications associayed they have an obligation to do so.
