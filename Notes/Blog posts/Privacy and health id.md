- what is the fundamental point of privacy, how it allows state to take advantage and fuck you.
- Disaggregate systems will be combined and doesn't protect the infividual.
- Highly personal data and state using it to justify it own means - 
- Insurances can use this to better plan, but will weaken the Individual response

My keytakeaways from the [[Privacy 3.0]] was Privacy is a human construct owing to technology, whereas the same time it's our nemesis.


> Privacy is not of nature; it is born of technology and is unique to mankind. But as much as it owes its creation to technology, it is technology that is its biggest nemesis.

\- Doug Engelbart, 1961



### Final article

In his address to the nation on the 74th Independence day, Prime Minister Modi  announced a national health ID for every Indian. The health ID will be a repository of all health-related information for every person. Every person who wishes to have an digital health records will have an health ID which will be linked to a health data consent manager such as National Digital Health Mission (NDHM). It will ask for consent and then allow for information transfer. 

According to NITI Aayog, a digital health ID aim to "greatly reduce the risk of preventable medical errors and significantly increase quality of care". Additionally, it would enable the users “to obtain a longitudinal view of their healthcare records”. Ultimately, the goal is to create an integrated health information system that increases efficiency and transparency among all public and private heathcare stakeholders.

But the proposal doesn't outline the privacy implications completely and India still without a data protection law and autonomous data protection authority, there are real concerns regarding infringment of citizens privacy. There are concerns over exclusion from necessary services, mass surveillance, prejudices against sexual and physical minorities. The government needs to clearly define a complete policy framework that safeguards against the privacy concerns.

Firstly, India should have a privacy protection law and an independent data protection authoriy in place before the widespread adoption of the health ID among its citizens. 	The personal data protection Bill, 2019 — that as per some commentators doesn't provide full protection to the public, and at the same time makes it harder for new companies to setup — needs to be reformed and implemented quickly.

Moreover, The policy framework should broaden the consent framework than what is currently proposed. There is a lack of education regarding the implications of health sensitive data or in general personal data among the public. Moreover, there exists an information assymetry between the public and the organisations which will make use of the data. Therefore, to assume that the public will make a well-informed decision to share their data is misjudged. The government should put the responsibility on the organisations.

Additionally, the government should allow a mechanism for public to gauge the reliability of the organisation to whom they might share their data. The independent data protection authority proposed above should design a rating system that rates different organisations participating in the new digital infrastructure that allows users to judge quickly which organisations can be trusted with their data.

In summary, while the national health id does have the potential to increase the efficiency and transparency of the India's thinly spread healthcare infrastructure. The government still needs to define a robust privacy framework necessary to safeguard the public against a number of privacy concerns by first passing a privacy protection law, making organisations more accountance for users consent, and building a mechansim that allows for rating the different organisation that will consume public's data.

### Notes:

But without a data protection law or an independent data protection authority, there are few safeguards and no recourse if rights are violated, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at Access Now, a digital rights non-profit.
“It will possibly be the largest centralised health ID and data storage system in the world, and it is being done in the absence of a data protection law and data protection authority,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“Health is a state subject, but the central government is rushing this policy in the middle of a public health emergency, and forcing states to play ball. It’s very problematic.
The government has repeatedly denied charges of data misuse or surveillance, even as large numbers of people remain excluded and many are denied essential services, a report by consulting firm Dalberg said last year.
The new Health ID has the potential to be made mandatory and deny services to those who opt-out, while also posing the risk of data abuse, human rights campaigners say.
The draft policy is only available online and in English, thus preventing access to a large majority of people, said Satendra Singh, a physician and disability rights campaigner who petitioned to extend the deadline for feedback to Sept. 21.

The policy also allows the sharing of anonymised data with third parties – “a matter of grave concern”, particularly for sexual minorities and those with disabilities, he said.

“The privacy implications of such data sharing requires in-depth examination because anonymised data can be identified if combined with other data sets such as voter records,” he said.

“The government says it wants to do analytics and trend forecasting to improve the healthcare system – that is a form of health surveillance,” he said.
