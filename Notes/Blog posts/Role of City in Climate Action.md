# Role of City in Climate Action


1. Why cities are best placed
2. The challenges they face
3. What needs to be done
4. Summary


Cities are the culprit and victim when it comes to climate change. They are home to more than half of the world’s people, and by 2050, and are projected to rise to 68 percent. According to some estimates, cities are responsible for 75% of the greenhouse gaes emission. At the same time, they are most at risk with changes brought in by climate change such as floods, droughts, storms. However, Different cities dace different climate risks, and hence they need different adaptation and mitigation policies.

Most major cities in the world understand the need for climate action, and hold the most potential to tackle the problem. Some major Indian cities are also rolling out their climate climate action plan, for example, Maharashtra Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Friday unveiled the Climate Action Plan for Mumbai in late August. However, there are doubts about the effectiveness of these plans and how they aligns with the national level plans.

While Indian cities are best placed when it comes to tackling the challenges from the climate change, there curently face several obstacles. First, they lack the funds and resources necessary to enact their climate action plans. Second, they lack the political capital and will to prioritise climate actions. Third, they lack the required knowledge and capabilites necessary to build a robust and inclusive climate action plan. Finally, these climate action plans are developed without much citizen participation, and with many of these plans hinges on behavioural change among citizens, their lack of involevement calls into questions the plan's effectiveness. 

Formulation  and implementation of a climate action plan that serves best the city-specific climate challenges, several things needs to happen. First, the cities should be alloted enough funds and allowed to raise some of it themselves through  taxation and other avenues. Second, rather than having a top-down trickling of climate goals from the national to state to city level, it should be vice-versa with each city better placed to assess it's own climate challenges. The national level goals should be aligned with these city level goals, and would require close collaboration among the national and city level stakeholders. Finally, cities should find ways to involve thier citizens and include their needs and ideas in their plan. This would not only allow them to include the real ground level issues but also would increase the acceptance and adoption of their climate action plan.

Additionally, Indian cities could benefit from joining global networks of climate action such as C40, ICLEI, GCom. This could potentially provide them the much needed resources and political capital to enact their climate plans. They would also recieve support and guidance in every aspect of their climate actions — formulation, implementation, assesement, etc. Mumbai joined the C40 Cities Network in December 2020, and is only the fifth Indian city in that global network. More Indian cities needs to be part of these global networks.

Climate risk is real and it's here. It will have huge impact on urban life, and would affect different places in ways which are still unpredictable. Local knowledge is critical to tackle the climate risk and cities needs to play a more central role in this fight against climate change.

Cities sometimes lack the resources and political capital to enact their climate actions. Therefore, many cities are part of global networks of climate actions such as C40, ICLEI, GCoM to support and get guidance on their climate action.

Mumbai joined the C40 Cities Network in December 2020, to become only the fifth Indian city in the global network. The Mumbai Climate Action Plan’s main objective is to create a comprehensive strategy to tackle the challenges of climate change by adopting inclusive and robust mitigation and adaptation strategies.

COVID 19 has substantially altered the city's climate action plan due to its huge impact on urban mobility, urban real estate development, and public health.

  

Problems for cities in achieving their climate action plan.

-   Most of the plans are without citizen participation.
    
-   Most of the plans involving behavioural change fail due to lack of citizen engagement.
    
-   Many plans in the climate action are based on a top-down approach(some based on international or state level goals and some based on other cities' networks). This is different from the actual needs of their residents and hence causes lack of participation and enthusiasm.
    
-   Urban policy makers and practitioners face a critical lack of data because traditional methods for collecting planning data are time- and cost-intensive. 
    

Opportunity areas:

The opportunity lies in strengthening the communication between citizens who have a willingness to act more sustainable and the city’s administration who are undertaking their own climate action. For example:

-   Digital solutions that can support cities and municipalities in collecting data from its citizens, which will contribute to the planning process and tracking the effectiveness of their actions.
    
-   Solutions fostering citizen engagement and inculcating behavioural changes for climate change.
