# 0. Introduction

-   Design rules are more like laws and based on human psychology. You need to know the underlying principles to adapt them based on the use-case.

# 1. Our perception is Biased

-   Biased by atleast 3 factors: The past, the present- current context, and the future- the goals.
-   Perpetual priming and mental frames bias for expectations
-   Habituaion
-   Attentional blink
-   But visual perception—reading in particular—is not strictly a bottom-up process. It includes top-down influences too. For example, the word in which a character appears may affect how we identify the character
-   Perceptions in any of our five senses may affect simultaneous perceptions in any of our other senses.
-   Perception biased by goals
    -   **Guide** our perceptual apparatus, so we sample what we need from the world around us.
    -   **Filter** our perceptions: things unrelated to our goals tend to be filtered out preconsciously, never registering in our conscious minds.
-   Design implications: - Avoid ambiguity , Be consistent, Understand the goals

# 2. Our Vision is optimised to see structure

-   An intelligent being have to deduce the implications from what it knows, but only the relevant implications.
-   One of their basic findings was that human vision is holistic: our visual system automatically imposes structure on visual input and is wired to perceive whole shapes, figures, and objects rather than disconnected edges, lines, and areas.
-   Gestalt Principles
-   With all these Gestalt principles operating at once, unintended visual relationships can be implied by a design. A recommended practice, after designing a display, is to view it with each of the Gestalt principles in mind—Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, Symmetry, Figure/Ground, and Common Fate—to see if the design suggests any relationships between elements that you do not intend.

# 3. We Seek and use visual structure

-   Perceiving structure in our environment helps us make sense of objects and events quickly.
-   Strcuture enhances peoples ability’s to scan long mnumbers
-   VISUAL HIERARCHY LETS PEOPLE FOCUS ON THE RELEVANT INFORMATION

# 4. Our Color Vision is limited

-   Our vision is optimized to detect contrasts (edges), not absolute brightness.
-   Our ability to distinguish colors depends on how colors are presented.
-   Some people have color-blindness.
-   The user’s display and viewing conditions affect color perception.

### Guidelines for using Color:

-   Distinguish color using saturation and brightness, as well as hue
-   Use distinctive colors
-   Separate strong opponent colors
-   Use color redundantly with other cues.

# 5. Peripheral Vision is poor

-   Stationary items in muted colors presented in the periphery of people’s visual field often will not be noticed.
-   Motion in the periphery is usually noticed.
-   Peripheral Vision is for:
    -   Guiding fovea
    -   Detect Motion
    -   Lets us see better in the dark

> We experience this illusion because our eyes move rapidly and constantly about three times per second even when we don’t realize it, focusing our fovea on selected pieces of our environment. Our brain fills in the rest in a gross, impressionistic way based on what we know and expect.

-   Visual search is linear unless targets "POP" in the periphery
-   Heavy artillery for making users notice messages
    -   Pop-up message in error dialog box
    -   Use sound
    -   Wiggle or blink
    -   put it where user is looking
    -   Mark the error - color, symbol

> That is why applications should never move items around in menus, lists, or pallets. Doing that prevents users from learning item positions, thereby dooming them to search linearly forever.

# 6. Reading is unnatural

-   Reading is training our visual system

> Closest to the fixation point is where word recognition takes place. This zone is usually large enough to capture the word being fixated, and often includes smaller function words directly to the right of the fixated word. The next zone extends a few letters past the word recognition zone, and readers gather preliminary information about the next letters in this zone. The final zone extends out to 15 letters past the fixation point. Information gathered out this far is used to identify the length of upcoming words and to identify the best location for the next fixation point.

> Feature-driven, bottom-up reading dominates; context assists

-   Skilled and unskilled reading use different parts of the brain - sounding out or not
-   Poor information design disrupt reading
    -   uncommon language
    -   difficult typefaces and sizes
    -   text on noisy background
    -   Centered and right aligned
    -   Minimize the need for reading

# 7. Our attention is limited; Our memory is imperfect

-   Long term Memory: Memory formation consists of changes in the neurons involved in a neural activity pattern, which make the pattern easier to reactivate in the future.
    
-   Short-Term memory: short-term memory is actually a combination of phenomena involving perception, attention, and retrieval from long-term memory.
    
-   Characteristics of Attention and Working memory:
    
    -   Attention is highly selective and focused - Movement, threats, faces, Sex and food
    -   Capacity of attention - The unit of attention and therefore the capacity of working memory—is best measured in item features rather than whole items or “chunks”
    
    > The basic implication is that user interfaces should help people remember essential information from one moment to the next. Don’t require people to remember system status or what they have done, because their attention is focused on their primary goal and progress toward it.
    
-   Characteristics of Long-term Memory:
    
    -   Error prone
    -   Weighted by emotions
    -   Retroactively alterable
    
    > implication of long-term memory characteristics for interactive systems is that learning and long-term retention are enhanced by user-interface consistency.
    

# 8. Limits on Attention shape our thought and action

-   we focus on our goals and pay little attention to our tools
-   we notice things more when they are related to our goals
-   we use external aids to keep track of what we are doing
-   we follow the information “scent” toward our goal
-   we prefer familiar paths
-   after we achieve a task’s primary goal, we often forget cleanup steps

# 9. Recognition is easy and recall is hard

Patterns of neural activity, which is what memories are, can be activated in two different ways:

1.  By more perceptions coming in from the senses.
2.  By other brain activity.

Recognition is essentially perception and long-term memory working in concert.

In contrast, **recall** is long-term memory reactivating old neural patterns without i ate similar perceptual input.

### Design implications

-   see and choose, using pictures
-   Visual recognition is fast and reliable, so designers can use visual cues to show users instantly where they are.

# 10. Learning from Experience and Performing Learned Actions are Easy; Novel Actions, Problem Solving, and Calculation are Hard

-   Old brain, the mid brain and the new brain
-   2 minds - System I
    -   When it encounters a problem it can’t solve, it substitutes an easier problem and solves that. For example, accurately answering the question “Is asparagus a popular vegetable?” requires engaging system two and either conducting a survey or looking up and reading survey results, which takes time and effort. System one just tosses that question out and quickly answers the question “Do I like asparagus?”
    -   It bases judgments only on what it perceives; it doesn’t care that important (potentially conflicting) information might exist. If such data is not present, it doesn’t exist.
    -   It filters perceptions based on goals and beliefs given to it by system two: information that doesn’t match is filtered out before reaching system two.
-   and System II
    -   CEO - executive functions
-   Learning from experiences is easy - our expectations influences us more, then family and then others we learn about
-   Even though there are limits on how well we learn from direct experience and from the experience of others, learning and generalizing from experience are relatively easy for the human mind.
-   Performing learned actions is easy and novel actions is hard
-   Problem solving and calculation is HARD

### Design implications

-   Prominently indicate system status and users’ progress toward their goal. If users can always check their status easily by direct perception, using the system will not strain their attention and short-term memory.
-   Guide users toward their goals. Designers can do this implicitly, by making sure every choice-point provides a clear information “scent” that leads users toward their goal, or explicitly, by using a wizard (multistep dialog box). Don’t just display a bunch of options that appear equally likely and expect users to know how to start and get to their goal, especially if they won’t perform the task very often.
-   Tell users explicitly and exactly what they need to know. Don’t expect them to deduce information. Don’t require them to figure things out by a pro cess of elimination.
-   Don’t make users diagnose system problems. For example, a faulty network connection. Such diagnosis requires technical training, which most users don’t have.
-   Minimize the number and complexity of settings. Don’t expect people to optimize combinations of many interacting settings or parameters. People are really bad at that.
-   Let people use perception rather than calculation. Some problems that might seem to require calculation can be represented graphically, allowing people to achieve their goals with quick perceptual estimates instead of calculation.
-   Make the system familiar. Use concepts, terminology, and graphics that users already know to make the system as familiar to them as possible, requiring them to think about it less.

# 11. Many factors affect learning

-   .We learn faster when:
    -   Practice is frequent, regular, and precise.
    -   Operation is task focused, simple, and consistent.
    -   Vocabulary is task focused, familiar, and consistent.
    -   Risk is low.

> Developing task-focused, familiar, consistent terminology is easier with a good conceptual model

> The good news is that when you perform a task analysis and develop a task-focused conceptual model, you also get the vocabulary your target user population uses to talk about the tasks. You don’t have to make up new terms for the user-visible concepts in your application—you can use the terms that people who do the task already use

# 12. Human Decision making is rarely rational

-   Loses means more to us than gains - kahneman 2*2 matrix
-   We are biased by how things are worded
-   We are biased by vivid imaginations and memories
-   Exploiting Strengths and weaknesses of Human cognition
    -   Support rational decision making: Help sys II override or co-opt sys I - DSS
        
        -   Provide all options. If there are too many to simply list, organize or abstract them into categories and subcategories, and provide summary information for those, so people can evaluate and compare entire categories of options at once.
            
        -   Help people find alternatives. Some solutions may be so counterintuitive that people don’t consider them. Decision support systems can expose options users might miss and can generate variants on user solutions that are minor or even major improvements.
            
        -   Provide unbiased data. That is, data created or collected in an objective, reproducible manner.
            
        -   Don’t make people calculate. Perform calculations, inferences, and deductions for users where possible. Computers are good at that; people aren’t.
            
        -   Check assertions and assumptions. Decisions are based not only on data, but also on assumptions and assertions. Decision support systems—especially those supporting critical or complex decisions—should let users declare any assumptions and assertions upon which a decision will be based, and then should “sanity check” them for the user.
            
        -   Data visualisation: Harnessing system I to support Sys II
            
            -   Chernoff reasoned that because human faces are multidimensional, any m tidimensional data can be represented as schematic faces, thereby exploiting our built-in face-recognition ability to allow people to recognize similarities, rela tionships, and patterns. Chernoff faces (see Fig. 12.7 ) have been used to repre sent a wide variety of data, from planets in the solar system to financial transactions.
            
            > Data visualization is a way to employ automatic visual perception processes built into system one to help system two understand complex data
            
            ### Persuasive systems V/s decision support systems
            

# 13. Our Hand-eye coordination follows laws

-   FITTS Law
    
    -   Although the basic prediction of Fitts’ law—people hit on-screen targets faster the closer they are and the larger they are—seems pretty intuitive, the law also predicts something less intuitive: the more the distance decreases or the target grows, the less the decrease in pointing time. If a target is tiny and you double its size, the time people take to hit it decreases, but if you double the size again, the pointing time doesn’t improve quite as much. So beyond a certain size, making a target even larger provides little added benefit (see Fig. 13.3), and below a certain distance, moving a target even closer doesn’t help much.
    -   A final noteworthy prediction of Fitts’ law is that, if the pointer or finger is blocked from moving past the edge of the screen, targets at the edge will be very easy to hit:
-   Steering Law:
    
    -   Steering law (Accot and Zhai, 1997). It says that if you must keep a pointer within a certain confined path while moving it to a target, then the wider the path, the faster you can move the pointer to the target
    -   Like Fitts’ law, the Steering law seems like common sense: a wider path means you need not move the pointer carefully; you can move it ballistically—that is, fast.

# 14. We have time requirements

> system’s responsiveness—its ability to keep up with users, keep them informed about its status, and not make them wait unexpectedly—is the most important factor in determining user satisfaction. It is not just one of the most important factors; it is the most important factor. 1 It is more important than ease of learning. It is more important than ease of use

-   Responsiveness is related to performance, but is different. Performance is measured in terms of computations per unit of time. Responsiveness is measured in terms of compliance with human time requirements and user satisfaction.

1.  Let you know immediately that your input was received.
2.  Provide some indication of how long operations will take (see Fig. 14.1). Free you to do other things while waiting.
3.  Manage queued events intelligently.
4.  Perform housekeeping and low-priority tasks in the background. Anticipate your most common requests.

### DESIGNING TO MEET REAL-TIME HUMAN INTERACTION DEADLINES

To be perceived by users as responsive, interactive software must follow these guidelines:

1.  Acknowledge user actions instantly, even if returning that the answer will take time; preserve users’ perception of cause and effect.
2.  Let users know when the software is busy and when it isn’t.
3.  Free users to do other things while waiting for a function to finish.
4.  Animate movement smoothly and clearly.
5.  Allow users to abort (cancel) lengthy operations they don’t want.
6.  Allow users to judge how much time lengthy operations will take.
7.  Do its best to let users set their own work pace.
8.  In these guidelines, instantly means within about 0.1 second.
