## Summary

#### Intro
1.   Emotions are critical for decision making
1.   Both affect and cognition are information processing systems. Moreover, they influence each other
    1.   the cognitive system interprets and makes sense of the word.
    1.   Affect is the general term for judgemental system, whether subconscious pr conscious. EMOTION is the conscious experience of Affect, complete with attribution of its cause and identification of itst object.
    

#### 1. Attractive things work better

1.   Emotions system changes how cognitive system operates. More advance animals are more emotional than more primitive animal
1.   Three levels of processing: Visceral, Behavioural(everyday behaviour), and Reflective(contemplative)
    1.   Visceral is fast; it makes judgement fast
    1.   Behavioural level is where skilled performers excel; We are not conscious
1.   Focus and Creativity
    1.   bottom-up processes driven by perception and top-down by thought
    1.   When we are happy we can be more creative, and stressful situation demands attention and focus
1.   Moods, traits and personality. though we can overcome our biological heritage
1.   The behavioural and reflective levels are very sensitive to culture, experiences, training, and education.

#### 2. the multiple faces of Emotion and Design

1.   Visceral design is about the initial impact of a product, its appearance, touch and feel.
1.   Behavioural level is about use, experience with a product. Experience itself has many facets: Function, performance and usability
1.   Only at reflective level consciousness reside â†’ which is also most vulnerable to culture
1.   Time â†’ V, B â†’ now ; reflective â†’ long-term
2.  Most product have to be sensitive to the differences among people â†’ one option wide variety of offerings
1.   Appropriateness to setting

- > Wants can be more powerful to than needs in determining the success of the product

1.   Product image affects reflective aspect
1.   Emotional appeal of memories, and photographs(as it has a story, a moment, and a memory)
1.   Leveraging the elements of SELF - which is hard to achieve in design tho there are certain universal ideals to aim for

### The personality of products

1.   match the market segment
1.   and must be consistent
1.   Brands are all about emotional responses, which are about judgements are so important in commerce.

> Attractive things do better - by producing positive emotions, causing meental processes to be more creative, more tolerant of minor difficulties

# 3. Three level of Design

1.   The principles underlying visceral design are wired in consistent across people and cultures

- ðŸ’¡ Cuz Visceral design is about initial reactions, it can be studied by quite simply putting it in-front of people


1.   Behavioural design is all about use. Performance matters, not rationale â†’ usability. FUNCTION comes first. â†’ human centred design
	1.   1.   Because people are unaware of their needs, we need research
	2. 1.   Designer's model, user model and system image should converge
1.   Reflective Design is all about Message, about culture, about the meaning of the product and its use. Also self-image and personal remembrances.
	1. 1.   Attractiveness comes from visceral-level and beauty from reflective
	2. 2.   Reflective design is also about long-term customer experience
	3. 3.   Reflective design should be guided by one with clear Vision. it's kind of artistry.

> Reflective values outweighs the behavioural difficulties



#### 4. Fun and Games
-   Lionel tiger's 4 kinds of pleeasure
        -   Physio-pleasure
    -   Socio-pleasure â†’ behavioural and reflective
    -   psycho-pleasure â†’ people's psychological states while using products â†’ behavioural
    -   Ideo-pleasure â†’ aestheticsâ†’ reflective
    
    > Great deseign can be appreciated even after continual use, continued presence
    
-   Longetivity in terms of excitement, interest and aesthetic pleasure derives from richness and complexity of structure.

1.   3 Basic steps
    
    1.   Enticement: make an emotional promise

        1.   something deeper about juicing experiences

> Sound can be playful, informative, fun and emotionally inspiring. Need careful designs to leverage it

> Learn from movies

#### 5. People, Places and Things

1.   Anthromorphism
1.   Blaming inanimate objects
1.   Trust and Design is really important - reliance, confidence, and integrity, although we live in the untrustworthy world
- 
#### 6. Emotional machines

1.   Design rules are more like laws and based on human psychology. You need to know the underlying principles to adapt them based on the use-case.

#### 7. Future of Robots

1.   Design rules are more like laws and based on human psychology. You need to know the underlying principles to adapt them based on the use-case.
