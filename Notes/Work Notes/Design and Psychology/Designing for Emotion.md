# 1. Emotional Design

-   People will forgive shortcomings, follow your lead, and sing your praises if you reward them with positive emotion.
-   Emotional design isn‚Äôt just about copy, photos, or design style: it‚Äôs a different way to think about how you communicate.‚Äù

> "Tumblr recognizes that attention is a finite commodity. Every time we add content to an interface, it makes it harder for humans to identify patterns and contrasting elements. The result is more unpredictable user behavior, and lower information retention‚Äù

> ‚ÄúWhen contrast is overused, we struggle to process our options, as Hick‚Äôs Law dictates. And, we discovered that aesthetics is more than just window dressing‚Äîit influences usability, as the aesthetic-usability principle illustrates‚Äù

# 3. Personality is the platform for Emotion

-   Emotional design‚Äôs primary goal is to facilitate human-to-human communication. If we‚Äôre doing our job well, the computer recedes into the background, and personalities rise to the surface. To achieve this goal, we must consider how we interact with one another in real life.
-   Personality can manifest itself in an interface through visual design, copy amnd interactions.
