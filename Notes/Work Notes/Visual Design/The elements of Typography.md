# 2. Grand Design

### first principles

-   Typography exists to honor content
    -   Aristotle catharsis
    -   Plato view of poetry
-   Letters have life and dignity of their own
-   There is style beyond style:
    -   It means typography that can walk familiar ground without sliding into platitudes, typography that responds to new conditions with innovative solutions, and typography that does not vex the reader with its own originality in a self-conscious search for praise.
    -   Typography is to literature as musical performance is to composition: an essential act of interpretation, full of endless opportunities for insight or obtuseness.

### tactics

-   Read the text before designing it
-   Discover the outer layer of typography in the inner logic of the text.
-   Make the visible relationship between the text and other elements (photographs, captions, tables, diagrams, notes) a reflection of their real relationship.
-   Choose a typeface or a group offaces that will honor and elucidate the character of the text.
    -   Letterforms have tone, timbre, character, just as words and sentences do. The moment a text and a typeface are chosen, two streams of thought, two rhythmical systems, two sets of habits, or if you like, two personalities, intersect. They need not live together contentedly forever, but they must not as a rule collide
-   Shape the page and frame the textblock so that it honors and reveals every element, every relationship between elements, and every logical nuance of the text.
-   Give full typographic attention even to incidental details

> invite the reader into the text; â€¢ reveal the tenor and meaning of the text; â€¢ clarify the structure and the order of the text; â€¢ link the text with other existing elements; â€¢ induce a state of energetic repose, which is the ideal condition for reading.

# 3. Rhythm and proportion

### Horizontal motion

<aside> ðŸ’¡ the design of the type, the spacing between the letters, the spacing between the words, and the spacing between the lines. None is independent of the others.

</aside>

-   Define the word space to suit the size and natural letter.fit of the font.
    -   For a normal text face in a normal text size, a typical value for the word space is a quarter of an em, which can be written M/4.
    -   If the text is justified, a reasonable minimum word space is a fifth of an em (M/5), and M/4 is a good average to aim for.
-   Choose a comfortable measure.
    -   The 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces) is widely regarded as ideal. For multiple-column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters.
-   Set ragged if ragged setting suits the text and the page.
-   Use a single word space between sentences.
-   Add little or no space within strings of initials
-   Letterspace all strings of capitals and small caps, and all long strings of digits.
-   Don't letterspace the lower case without a reason.
-   Kern consistently and modestly or not at all. â†’ Numbers often needs more kerning than letters
-   Don't alter the widths or shapes of letters without cause.
-   Don't stretch the space until it breaks.

### Vertical Motion

-   Choose a basic leading that suits the typeface, text and measure.
    -   Longer measures need more lead than short ones. Dark faces need more lead than light ones. Large-bodied faces need more lead than smaller-bodied ones. Faces like Bauer Bodoni, with substantial color and a rigid vertical axis, need much more lead than faces like Bembo, whose color is light and whose axis is based on the writing hand. And unserifed faces often need more lead (or a shorter line) than their serifed counterparts
-   Add and delete vertical space in measured intervals
    -   Subheads in this book are leaded in the simplest possible way, with a white line
    -   Verse and similar formats requires more leading
-   Don't suffocate the Page
    -   the page must breathe, and in book - that is, in a long text fit for the reader to live in - the page must breathe in both directions. The longer the line, the more space necessary between lines. Two columns of short lines are therefore more compact than a single column of long lines.

Blocks and paragraphs

-   Set opening paragraphs flush left.
-   In continuous text, mark all paragraphs after the first with an indent of at least one en or em/2.
-   Add extra lead before and after block quotations.
-   Indent or center verse quotations.

### ETIQUETTE OF HYPHENATION & PAGINATION

-   At hyphenated line-ends, leave at least two characters behind and take at least three forward.
-   Avoid leaving the stub-end of a hyphenated word, or any word shorter than four letters, as the last line of a paragraph
-   Avoid more than three consecutive hyphenated lines.
-   Hyphenate proper names only as a last resort unless they occur with the frequency of common nouns.
-   Hyphenate according to the conventions of the language.
-   Link short numerical and mathematical expressions with hard spaces.
-   Avoid beginning more than two consecutive lines with the same word.
-   Never begin a page with the last line of a multi-line paragraph.
-   Balance facing pages by moving single lines.
-   Avoid hyphenated breaks where the text is interrupted.
-   Abandon any and all rules of hyphenation and pagination that Jail to serve the needs of the text.

# 4. Harmony and counterpoint

### Size

-   Don't compose without a Scale

### Numerals, capitals and full caps

-   Use titling figures with full caps, and text figures in all other circumstances.
-   For abbreviations and acronyms in the midst of normal text, use spaced small caps.
-   Refer typographic disputes to the higher courts of speech and thinking.

### Ligatures

-   Use the ligatures required by the font, and the characters required by the language, in which you are setting type.
-   If you wish to avoid ligatures altogether, restrict yourself to faces that don't require them.

### Tribal alliances and Families

-   To the marriage of type and text, both parties bring their cultural presumptions, dreams and family obligations. Accept them.
-   Don't use a font you don't need.
-   Use sloped romans sparingly and artificially sloped romans more sparingly still.

### Contrast

-   Change one parameter at a time
-   Don't clutter your foreground

# 5. Structural forms and devices

### Openings

-   Make the title page a symbol of the dignity and presence of the text.
    -   Big type, even huge type, can be beautiful and useful. But poise is usually far more important than size - and poise consists primarily of emptiness.
-   Don't permit the titles to oppress the text.
-   Set titles and openings in a form that contributes to the overall design.
-   Mark each beginning and resumption of the text
    -   The simplest way of beginning any block of prose is to start from the margin, flush left, as this paragraph doe
-   If the text begins with a quotation, include the initial quotation mark.

### Headings and subheadings

-   Set headings in a form that contributes to the style of the whole.
-   Use as many levels of headings as you need: no more and no fewer.

### Notes

-   If the text includes notes, choose the optimum form.
-   Check the weight and spacing of superscripts.
-   Use superscripts in the text but full-size numbers in the notes themselves.
-   Avoid ambiguity in the numbering and placement of endnotes.

### Tables and Lists

-   Edit tables with the same attention given to text, and set them as text to be read.
-   Avoid overpunctuating lists.
    -   This means that the list should be clarified as much as possible through spatial positioning and pointing, usually done with bullets, dashes or numerals.
-   Set lists and columns of figures to align flush right or on the decimal.
-   For text and numerals alike, choose harmonious and legible tabular alignments.

### Front and back Matter

-   Leave adequate space at the beginning and end of every publication.
-   Give adequate space to the prelims.
-   Balance the front and back matter

# 6. Analphabetic symbols

### Analphabetic style

-   To invoke the inscriptional tradition, use the midpoint
-   Use analphabetic symbols and diacritics that are in tune with the basic font.
-   heads and titles, use the best available ampersand
-   Consider even the lowly hyphen
    -   Hyphens also once varied considerably in width, but most now are standardized to a quarter of an em. Sometimes a shorter hyphen is better.

### Dashes, Slashes, and Dots

-   Use spaced en dashes - rather than close-set em dashes or spaced hyphens - to set off phrases.
    -   Used as a phrase marker - thus - the en dash is set with a normal word space either side.
-   Use close-set en dashes or three-to-em dashes between digits to indicate a range.
-   Use the em dash to introduce speakers in narrative dialogue.
-   In lists and bibliographies, use a three-em rule when required as a sign of repetition.
-   Use the virgule(steep slash) with words and dates, the solidus with split level fractions.
-   Use a dimension sign ( x) instead of the letter x when dimensions are given.
-   Use ellipses that fit the font.
-   Treat the punctuation as notation, not expression, most of the time.

### Parenthesis

-   Use the best available brackets and parentheses, and set them with adequate space.
-   Use upright (i.e., "roman") rather than sloped parentheses, brackets and braces, even if the context is italic.
-   Minimize the use of quotation marks, especially with Renaissance faces.
-   Position quotation marks consistently in relation to the rest of the punctuation.
-   Omit the apostrophe from numerical plurals.
-   Add punctuation, or preserve it, where it is necessary to meaning.

# 7. Choosing and Combining Type

### Technical considerations

-   Consider the medium for which the typeface was originally designed.
    -   Aristotle catharsis
    -   Plato view of poetry
-   When using digital adaptations of letterpress faces, choose fonts that are faithful to the spirit as well as the letter of the old designs.
-   Choose faces that will survive, and if possible prosper, under the final printing conditions.
-   Choose faces that suit the paper you intend to print on, or paper that suits the faces you wish to use.

### Practical Typography

-   Choose face that suits the task as well as the subject.
-   Choose faces that can furnish whatever special effects you require.
    -   like does it have special numerals, capitals lowercase, italics as its own.
-   Use what there is to the best advantage.

### Historical considerations

-   Choose a face whose historical echoes and associations are in harmony with the text.
-   Allow the face to speak in its natural idiom.

### Cultural and Personal considerations

-   Choose faces whose individual spirit and character is in keeping with the text

### Multi-Cultural Page

-   Consistency is one of the forms of beauty. Contrast is another.
-   Start with a single typographic family.
-   respect the integrity of roman, italic and small caps.
    -   There are several celebrated instances in which an italic designed by one artist has been happily and permanently married to another designer's roma
-   Consider bold faces on their own merits.
-   Choose titling and display faces that reinforce the structure of the text face
-   Pair serifed and unserifed faces on the basis of their inner structure.
    -   When the basic text is set in a serifed face, a related sanserif is frequently useful for other elements, such as tables, captions or notes. In complicated texts, such as dictionary entries, it may also be necessary to mix unserifed and serifed fonts on the same line. If you've chosen a family that includes a matched sanserif, your problems may be solved. But many successful marriages between serifed and unserifed faces from different families are waiting to be made.

### Mixing alphabets

-   Choose non-latin faces as carefully as Latin ones.
-   Match the continuity of the typography to the continuity of thought.
-   Balance the type optically more than mathematically.

### New orthograhies

-   Add no unnecessary characters.
-   Add only characters that are visually distinct.
-   Avoid capricious redefinition offamiliar characters.
-   dont mix faces haphazardly when specialized sorts are

### Building a type library

-   Choose your library offaces slowly and well.
