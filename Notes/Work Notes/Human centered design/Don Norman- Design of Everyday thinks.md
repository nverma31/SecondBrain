# Design of Everyday Things

## Summary
> With the passage of time, the psychology of people stays the same, but the tools and objects in the world change. Cultures change. Technologies change. The principles of design still hold, but the way they get applied needs to be modified to account for new activities, new technologies, new methods of communication and interaction. 

## Chapters
- I. **Psycopathology of everyday things**: Conseuences of faulty design is that people can't use the products
	- **Affordances**: Defines what actions are possible, not so relevant in digital world, but makes more sense to the physical object
	- **Signifiers**: Signifiers specify how people discover those possibilities: signifiers are signs, perceptible signals of what can be done. Signifiers are of far more importance to designers than are affordances. 
	- A well-designed product teaches its users how to use it. One way to help consumers learn how to use products is to give them clear signs or clues.The design process needs to consider human psychology.
- **II. Psychology of everyday actions**: The design process needs to consider human psychology.
	- According to the author, users engage with a product on three different psychological levels. Any product, like your newly designed washing machine, must interact with these three psychological levels.
		- First comes the [[_visceral level_]], which corresponds to the unconscious behaviors we do without thinking, like breathing and digesting.
			- Say you need to wash some clothes for a business meeting. On the reflective level, you have a problem (dirty clothes), which require you to have a plan (which wash cycle) to accomplish a goal (can we wear these clothes to the meeting?). Therefore, to easily engage your reflective level, the machine should have many options to fit your different problems and plans.
		- Next comes the[[ _behavioral level_]]. This level includes the quick reflexes we use when we play sports, like catching a ball, or short-timed responses to actions, like pulling our hand away from a fire. These are conscious responses, but don’t allow us a lot of time to think about them.
			- At the behavioral level, you implement the plan by selecting the options (setting the wash cycle) and interpreting the results (are the clothes clean?). The machine cycles should therefore be simple and quick to select, and there should be a clear signal to the user at the end of the washing process.
		- Finally, the [[_reflective level_]] is the realm of conscious, higher cognitive functions where we perform complex planning and problem solving.
			- At the behavioral level, you implement the plan by selecting the options (setting the wash cycle) and interpreting the results (are the clothes clean?). The machine cycles should therefore be simple and quick to select, and there should be a clear signal to the user at the end of the washing process.
- **III. Knowlegde in the head and in the world**
- **IV. Knowing what to do:Constraints, Discoverability, and Feedback**
	- Good design uses product constraints to help the user understand the product.: IKEA assembly as an example.
	- Well-designed products communicate with users by providing feedback.
- **V. Human Error? Bad design:**
- **VI. Design thinking:**
	- The key to fixing bad design is to find the “root cause” of the problem. Through [[_design_ _thinking_]]: an open inquiry method used for diagnosing and solving problems
- **VII. Design in the world of Business**
	- Design needs to be human-centered to bring technology and people closer together.
	- Successful products require patience and cooperation between marketers and designers.
