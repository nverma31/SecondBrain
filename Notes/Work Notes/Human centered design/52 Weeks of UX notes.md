## Summary

## Rules
1. First rule of UX
“**You cannot not communicate**. Every behaviour is a kind of communication. Because behaviour does not have a counterpart (there is no anti-behaviour), it is not possible not to communicate. 

2. What is User experience
**The user experience is made up of all the interactions a person has with your brand, company, or organization**. The interaction designer plans for these moments. Part of their responsibility is to make all interactions positive, and includes aspects of the software, the copy-writing, the graphics, layout, flows, physical experiences. It’s a shame when one part of the experience is top notch and another is dreadful. Cohesion is important. User experience spans multiple practices 

3. Solve existing problems 
To create great user experiences we need to **focus on the now.** In reality the problems of our users are painfully mundane and often obvious. It is our task to ease this pain, and in doing so we might not invent some amazing new thing, but that’s OK. Success is incremental.

4. Solutions are easy if you know the problem
You could say that actually solving the problem is good design in practice. As Bertrand Russell said, “The greatest challenge to any thinker [designer] is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.”

5. Deliverables vs Delivery That’s the difference: **deliverables are divorced from delivery. **

6. Sketch, Sketch, Sketch The sketch is not the end goal. The end goal of the drawing process is what you learn while sketching. So don’t worry if you can’t sketch. In fact, if you’re too good you might just fool yourself into thinking your sketch is a deliverable. It’s not. The real value of sketching is that it allows you to explore and refine ideas in a quick, iterative and visual manner with little overhead or learning curve. Rapid ideation around flow and interaction, layout and hierarchy, can be quickly established, rearranged or discarded wholesale—all without ever touching a computer. 

7. **Constraints Fuels creativity**  I say embrace your constraints and draw out of them the very solution that sets you apart from the crowd. Are there problems with the iPhone? Yes. Of course there are. The point is if you want to create a truly compelling experience, don’t complain about your constraints; embrace them. And in doing so, set your creativity on fire! 

8. **Overcoming our own subjectivity**  User experience designers, however, cannot long suffer this fate. We must design (and hopefully critique other designs) from a more objective viewpoint. As designers and critics we must get out of our own head. Subjectivity, our inability to see as others do, can be a cruel master. 

9. Utility vs Beauty  The most elegant solution will yield a design that is gracefully tempered with restraint and precision—both useful and beautiful. 

10. **Action first** Designers are an odd lot: creative, moody, pensive, thoughtful, weird. But the one characteristic that separates designers from others is action. They make stuff that didn’t exist before 

11. **Lifecycle Usage** First Contact First Time Use:  Ongoing Use: Passionate Use Death When you start framing design in terms of the usage lifecycle, you begin to see how each stage has different design challenges. What was a huge show-stopping issue for users at first contact is never a problem for them in later stages. What is a complex issue during regular use never occurs to someone just starting out. In this way the point at which people are in the lifecycle determines context for the user as much as anything else. Just as much as we need to “know your user” we need to know what they’re doing…rather, where they are in the usage lifecycle. 

12. You are not your user Take the time to understand your user. It will decrease the risk of creating an an unfavorable experience and give you an opportunity to turn them into your greatest advocate. 

13.  The power of frameworks  Structural Frameworks: Affect the way we move through space. Creating spaces that people live in and use. Offline known as architecture. Online known as interaction design/information architecture. We create the possibilities for action. In this way a web page is like a room…with certain opportunities and constraints. You can enter through certain doors (links, search engine, form submissions, etc), perform certain actions there, and then leave. Well-designed pages (and rooms) serve a specific purpose. Eating in the dining room is the best…eating in the bathroom is…not such a good experience.
			
		>Visual Frameworks: Affect the way we see things. The visual structure we build into every design 	affects the way people see it. Is our visual hierarchy strong so that people see what they are meant to see in the right order? Are elements appropriated weighted so that their relationships are clear? Do people gravitate toward the most important information on the page, or are there elements that distract? Can they see what to do next?
			> Social Frameworks: Affect the way we interact with others. What are the opportunities for social interaction? Can you poke people? Favorite them? Favorite something they did? How is reputation managed? Are you able to import or export your relationships, and (more importantly) does it make sense to do so? This is a vast area open for exploration. We have only begun to investigate social frameworks.
			>Conceptual Frameworks: Affect the way we think about something. Mostly communicated through words + images. Are people “registering” for your web site or “joining your community”? Are they “sharing the love” or “creating buzz”? Does this graphic help to illustrate the idea or make it more confusing? The words and images we use shape the way people think about what we build, and, in the long run become our brand. In too many cases we shape conceptual frameworks without much thought…our primary goal must be clarity. But upon achieving that, we can begin to nudge the experience further by creating a style guide…full of language and images we use to build a useful conceptual framework.
			>These frameworks do not stand on their own, of course. They overlap, intermingle, and co-exist. As UX designers we deal with all of them, often at the same time!

14. Makers of Frames We make frames.
In places both private and public, social and separate, consumers are navigating frameworks that we put forth. We’re no longer telling the whole story, creating the whole experience for our users, we’re suggesting it. We’re not rulemakers, we’re makers of frames, wherever those frames happen. Stalwart as ever in vision, we set loose boundaries, and give over part of the product to our audience, giving way to new stories and behaviors.
“The behavior you’re seeing is the behavior you’ve designed for.” —Joshua Porter As designers, as people, adjust the boundaries of your place. It is there you’ll see new meaning emerge, the behavior you designed for, and stories you never could have predicted.


15. Dieter Rams 
	>	Good design makes a product useful.
	>	Good design is innovative.
	Good design is aesthetic.
	Good design makes a product understandable.
	Good design is unobtrusive.
	Good design is honest.
	Good design is long-lasting.
	Good design is thorough down to the last detail.
	Good design is environmentally friendly.
	Good design is as little design as possible.

16.  **User interface is customer service for the computer**. For software going forward, help will be built into the user interface. It will be a part of the infrastructure, embedded in normal interface elements instead of being an add-on. If it’s not available in context, it might as well be invisible. 
17. Change existing Situations “**Everyone designs who devise courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.** The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences.”—Herbert Simon, The Sciences of the Artificial, 1962 
18. **Make Less more** What if instead of adding new features, a company concentrated on making the service or product much easier to use? Or making it much easier to access the advanced features it already has, but that few can master? Maybe what they lose in market share in one area will be more than compensated for in another area. In a lot of markets, it’s gotten so bad out there that simply being usable is enough to make a product truly remarkable.”—Kathy Sierra 
19. Visual heirarchy and Visual Weight Visual weight reinforces a page or screen’s visual hierarchy by contrasting the size, color and/or position of elements in the design. By adding visual weight to elements that are of primary importance and reducing the visual weight on elements of less importance you help guide the user and strengthen the overall design of the page or screen 
20.  Charles Eames said, "**The details are not the details. They make the design.**“ 
21. **Honest Interfaces**:  The integrity of the interface reflects how much you value your users.  And so we return to the point of this article: build honest interfaces. Build trust into the very fabric of your product. Evaluate your design choices by asking yourself, "does this element mislead the user in any way?” If it does, take steps to align the interface with the expected behavior/action.  
22. Principles of UX 
	1. 1. The Experience Belongs to the User: Designers do not create experiences, they create artifacts to experience. This makes all the difference. Since experience is subjective it cannot be designed in quite the same way that a physical product can. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t design the framework within which people experience our product/service. If our framework is solid, then great experiences will be a common occurrence.
	2. UX is Holistic: The experience is not just the product anymore. It is made up of all touch-points of a larger system, from the product to the support to the way your neighbor talks about it. Not all of these things are designable in the same way, but all can be designed for on some level. 
	3. Great User Experiences are Invisible: When people are having a great experience, they rarely notice the hard work that has been put into place to make it happen. This is as it should be…our job as UX professionals is to be so successful that nobody talks about us.  
	4. UX is a Lifecycle: People experience the world over time…nothing happens at once. As such, people don’t immediately have a good experience with most things. There is a lifecycle that must be gone through, starting with awareness, building up to first-time use and going into regular use and even decline. These steps are relatively stable. 
	5. Context is King: In an age when it is easy to create products and content quickly, the missing piece becomes context: how does what we create fit into the lives of the people we create it for? Discovering the ins and outs of context is why UX professionals do so much user research, as the subtleties of context are a sharp blade. 
	6. Great Experience is about Control: The worst feeling in the world is to feel out of control. When people feel out of control, they simply don’t have a good time. This doesn’t mean that you can’t surprise people or provide serendipity for them, it means that users need to feel like they are always able to take the next step (or bow out) at their request.
	7. UX is Social: Time was when a person’s experience with a computer was a solo affair. The most they did was to email someone and get a response. Boy have times changed! We are not dealing with individuals any longer…we’re dealing with entire social lives. Not only are we dealing with how a person behaves on their own, but we are dealing with how someone behaves in an ever-changing landscape of public to private, where each shade of gray affects their behavior differently. 
	8. Psychology is Primary: Software is getting easier to use all the time. The one with the psychological edge will win. This means that we have to dive deeply into the psychology of use, play, product adoption, and social interaction to create the best experiences. 
	9. UX is a Conversation: UX, like marketing, is a conversation. As UX professionals we are creating a dialog with users in which the goal is to find out how we can best help them do what they want to do. Therefore, UX becomes a service, not a one-off product, that is constantly reacting to the changing needs of our audience. The conversation is both how we deliver and how we find out how to make it better. 
	10. Great Experiences are Simple: Simplicity is much more than the trite “less is more” we so often hear. Simplicity is not about volume; it’s about clarity. If people can understand or use something with little difficulty, then you’ve made something simple. It may have been a Herculean effort to make it so, but simple is not always easy to design…it only appears that way.

22. Interview with Andy Budd  I am a User Experience Designer, but sometimes I do Information Architecture, sometimes I do usability testing, sometimes I do interface design.   I think a closer analogy of what we do is that of product design, we just do it in a digital space on the web. I think thats closer than saying we are User Experience Designers Usability heuristics, user experience heuristics - they are just guidelines.  Expertise comes from 10+ years, thousands of hours of making lots of mistakes and screwing up again and again and ultimately, getting good at what you do. 
23. Finding Flow When design reaches a certain threshold of simplicity it changes our relationship to it. It’s not clear how this works, as it doesn’t happen very often, but at some point we start thinking about what we’re doing differently. The design we’re using fades away, our experience improves dramatically, and the activity we’re doing becomes primary. This is as it should be. And if we’re really lucky we take another small step toward the ultimate goal: the goal of finding flow.  
24. The user experience belongs to the users Designers do not create experiences, we create artifacts to experience. We create tangible things that people use over time. If someone using our artifact has a good time while using it, they might be said to have a positive user experience. Once that happens, though, once a design has had contact with its users, and the designer observes that contact, the world changes. This is what social software is showing us each and every day: its core value is its ability to be something different for everyone, to be adaptable to people’s varying needs, to change over time, to be a subjective user experience.  
25. A picture is worth 1000 words, except when it isn’t It doesn’t matter if it is a picture, an infographic, a screenshot, or a product rendering, **all visual communication in your design leaves a cumulative impression on the user**. Take the time to make sure that every part of your visual communication on your site or around your product is reinforcing your message.  
26. **The process Police** Here’s the secret: the Process Police are secretly worried they’re doing it wrong.  The good thing about benchmarks is that you can to optimize for them. The bad thing about benchmarks is that you often have the wrong one.   But here’s an obvious question: shouldn’t the benchmark of a UX professional be happy users? Shouldn’t some metric of positive user experience be our benchmark instead of following some process exactly? What if we start optimizing for happy users over everything else? No process guarantees success. If there were a process that guaranteed happy users everyone would be using it. But design doesn’t work like that: it’s iterative, responsive, ever-changing. You have to react as much as plan. You have to change your process on the fly to react to the marketplace. That’s why we need to optimize for what’s most important, a happy user, and do whatever it takes to make it happen, process be damned.  
27. **Design for delight Delight. Surprise. Joy.**  The service industry has known this secret forever. There is a very short space of time and limited interaction to shape the experience for the customer 
28. Simplicity isn’t that Simple Anyone who occupies themselves with the task of creating truly usable products becomes instantly aware that achieving simplicity is not that simple. For any single feature in a product we must take into account the way it looks, the way it functions, its place in the overall system, affordances to help convey context of how and why it is to be used, as well as taking into account the motivation of the use. Designing for simplicity is a process of calculated refinement.  
29. [[UX engagement Metrics]] **Hits, page views, Visits, Unique visitors, Returning visitors, Registered Users, Customers, Frequency, Time on Site, Daily Active users.** Core engagement metrics will probably include some combination from the above list as you’ll constantly need to know if you have enough engaged people to keep you in business. 
30. **Experience Precedes Branding** Bierut suggests that we love the logos only after we’ve become accustomed to them, saying that it is the context in which we engage the logos that matter. I think Bierut is exactly right and it leads to a larger point: experience precedes branding. This has huge implications for design! Our perception of something (brand) is influenced primarily by actual experience. 
31. Design Involves Compromise “Design almost invariably involves compromise…. Rarely can the designer simply optimise one requirement without suffering losses elsewhere…. There are no established methods for deciding just how good or bad solutions are, and still the best test of most design is to wait and see how well it works in practice. Design solutions can never be perfect and are often more easily criticised than created, and designers must accept that they will almost invariably appear wrong in some ways to some people.” —Bryan Lawson 
32. **Control** The more things a user has to deal with when making a decision, the more likely they are to feel a sense of helplessness and find themselves unable to take the next step. Sometimes, due to the complexity of the interface, there isn’t a clear next step or even a way back.  Creating great experiences is all about control. For the user, control is knowing and understanding the options and being able to make the “right” decision. For the designer, control is about refining the interface until the user can always take the next step.  Hick’s Law is a design principle that states: “The time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of alternatives increases.”  Translation: more choices = more anxiety. Less choices = more control. At least in the mind of the user.  
33. Watch the Startups If you want to find the most innovative UX practitioners, watch the startups.  Startups are startup companies, newly-formed businesses made up of small teams moving extremely quickly to take advantage of an opportunity they see in the market. 
34. Forgiveness we, the designers and developers, need to ask forgiveness from our users. So often, when an error occurs users will often blame themselves and, unfortunately, because we give little to no help, they continue feeling like they have made the mistake. However, good copy can have a dramatic effect on people’s perception of a product. We are responsible for the experience and by admitting there was a problem and attempting to fix it as quickly as possible, we will engender the goodwill and hopefully, the return business of the user.  
35. Teach your users well In the Usage Lifecycle, the transition between First Time Use and Ongoing/Passionate Use can often be narrowed down to one crucial element: education.  The answer lies in what I like to call “**in-app education**” - simple, teachable moments in the First Time Use flow and beyond. These can be anything from simple helper tips that are activated when a user hovers over some content to a very clear set of steps to accomplish a specific task. Whether is is explicit step-by-step instructions or some subtle interface interaction that reveals more functionality, the fastest way to engage users and provide a clear path to rapid adoption is to build education right into your product from the start. 
36. **Cohort Analysis** This is where the cohort analysis proves valuable. By bucketing people into the month (or week) they started using the service, you can keep track of their engagement over time. You can now make assessments like “the March cohort is engaged better than the February cohort” and the like. If your numbers are flat month over month, which is often the case even if the face of impressive growth, then you have not improved user engagement over that time. 
37. Commander’s Intent Commander’s Intent is a simple goal made at the beginning of an engagement that holds throughout, no matter if the situation changes. Some tips when using the Commander’s Intent in design: 
    * If you don’t know what the one purpose of the screen is, then get rid of the screen. 
    * If you think a screen has two primary purposes, you can probably break it into two screens. 
    * If something on the screen doesn’t support the one purpose, get rid of it. 
    * If the one purpose does not add to a positive user experience, then get rid of the screen.  
38. Never Stop looking ahead “Ultimately, my job as a designer is to look into the future. Its not to use any frame of reference that exists, really. My job is about what is going to happen, not what has happened.” - Marc Newson Never stop dreaming. Never stop challenging “how its done.” Never stop looking ahead.  
39. The local maximum In order to design through the local maximum we need a balance between the science-minded testing methodology and the intuitive sense designers use when making big changes. We need to intelligently alternate between innovation and optimization, as both are required to design great user experiences.  And when the time comes to make the bigger changes, when you decide to jump from your local maximum to some other design possibility, make the decision with conviction. But don’t forget that the optimization has only just begun.  
40. There is no right answer So how do you find the better answers? You don’t find them by thinking about what approach might be best. You find them by working potential answers right through. For each alternative approach:
    * Design it to as detailed a level as possible: Some alternatives will disappear automatically when you start working with the nitty-gritty detail  of real life and real data
    * Test each approach: Some will fall apart when put to real-life use in front of real people. I don’t mean just by usability testing, but by getting an attempt out and seeing what happens.
    * Tweak the ones that work best
And most important, expect the best answer to change. As the context changes, so do good solutions. Keep tweaking & improving; and don’t try to find the single right answer. It doesn’t exist

41. The fundamental Attribution Error In social psychology, the fundamental attribution error describes the tendency to over-value dispositional or personality-based explanations for the observed behaviors of others while under-valuing situational explanations for those behaviors.  In design, since we’re designing to elicit behavior in other people, we often fall prey to the fundamental attribution error. We say things like “He’s an early adopter” or “She’s an influential” as if that somehow tells us what we need to know to design. The fundamental attribution error is pervasive…it is human nature to categorize people.  So next time you feel like asking “What type of user is this?” ask instead “Where is this person in the UX Lifecycle?” Thinking about where people are in a process, vs. what type of person they might be, can help us avoid the pervasive, seductive, fundamental attribution error.

41. Innovation - The next great buzz word Its time to stop feeling sorry for ourselves because we think no one is listening and start doing what we love: creating things that change peoples lives, even in the tiniest little ways.   
42. Gall’s Law “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.” - John Gall. The simple idea that, despite our most intricate and thorough planning, we cannot create complexity at the beginning but must instead start with something smaller, simpler, easier.  
43. Critique Me, please “Your design isn’t a work of art. It’s a business solution. Practice being critiqued.” — Matthew Smith (Squared Eye) The process of engaging in meaningful critique of your work decreases the amount of time spent holding on to design decisions that may not actually solve the problems you are facing and open the door to constructive conversations that highlight specific and actionable solutions you would not have arrived at on your own.  , “Practice being critiqued.” 
44. Email, the glue of UX   These are just the basic ways that email is useful in providing a positive user experience. And despite the rise of social networking email is still the primary way for out-of-app communications.  
45. Understanding the Journey Addressing each of these questions will go a long way in creating an experience that acknowledges the users journey and provides a clear path to engage with the product/service. A customer’s impression is cemented in a fraction of a second. Don’t underestimate how much of an impact the journey has on the emotional engagement of the customer.  
46. Turn your hippo into a UX Hero There can be little doubt that this will take more time and energy. But if you want to turn your HiPPO into a UX Hero, providing them with data, research and education gives them a chance to see how user-centric design thinking can create a more viable product. And hopefully, turn them into the champion of a new culture within the organization.  
47. The distance between user and Maker As the distance between the maker and user increases, so does the difficulty of designing a great user experience. 
In other words, the closer the designer and user are, the easier it is to design. When designers observe actual use, the problems jump out quickly. But as the layers between these two parties increases, so does the communication that must be done to have the same effect. Even if one person sits between the designer and user, the designer’s job is twice as hard. 

48. Timelessness Producing an enduring product or service in a society filled with "instant” everything is one of the greatest challenges we face as designers. It requires us to resist the path of least resistance, choosing instead to wage war on corner-cutting, on mediocrity, on irrelevance and indifference. 
Creating long lasting value does not happen by accident. It is the purposeful application of sensible design for real people.  
48. Emotion and Data Experience Design is about emotion, to be sure. But responding to emotion isn’t enough, you need to have hard data to back up your decisions. In the worst-case scenario the data doesn’t agree with the emotions of customers (as Apple may be experiencing now). In the best-case scenario, both emotions and data agree to give you an accurate picture of what’s going on. 

48. Time to delight Here’s a simpler but just as interesting metric you might try to measure:
How long does it take for a new visitor/customer to be delighted using your product or service?  Here are a few things you might measure:
    * Time to positive feedback - How long until someone gives you a thumbs up?
    * Time to smile - If you interact with people face-to-face, how long does it take for someone to smile at you?
    * Time to share - If you have a sharing feature, are people using it? Or, are they sharing it with social media or word-of-mouth? 
    * Time to create & save - How long until someone saves something that you let them create?  As our work becomes more about emotion and less about usability, time to delight might become a metric that has real meaning. The faster we can delight someone the first time, the faster we can re-delight them a second time.

48. Wireframing is not a religion There is no right way to wireframe. You must understand the context and the requirements for the project and move ahead accordingly. Know that regardless of the fidelity of the wireframe, it is still simply a tool in the design process that you can utilize to quickly get feedback, prove out your design decisions and help you make a better product.  

48. The Five W’s Who, What, Where, When, Why (and How - it ends with a “w” cut me some slack). In school we were taught that these fundamental questions must be addressed in the process of creating a strong argument and delivering a legitimate story. In the world of User Experience, being able to accurately answer these 5 questions can be the difference between a product that instantly resonates with the customer and one that quickly makes its’ way to the Startup Graveyard.  
49. Touch UX For those of you ready to dive in, here are a few resources to help you get started:
Touch Gesture Reference Guide 
Touch Gesture Diagrams 
http://www.designmultitouch.com/ (huge list of resources and history of multi-touch)
Mobile Design & Development 
Designing Gestural Interfaces 
iPad Human Interface Guidelines (concise version here)
Windows Touch Programming 
Remember, multi-touch interfaces don’t make computers more human, they allow us to be a little more human while we are using them.

50. **Rewards the passionate** So the next time you ask the question: “What’s the best way to bring in new customers?”, also ask yourself whether you can take advantage of the most important asset you have: your existing, passionate customers.  
51. **Chart Junk is not always bad** : You always need to remember that your goals, your readers’ goals and the data may not always align and you need to choose the right tool for the job. And chart junk, in some cases, might just be a valuable tool.
52. A good reminder from [Edward Tufte]
	> “There is no such thing as information overload, just bad design. If something is cluttered and/or confusing, fix your design.”
53. Be wary of Copycat Design
54.  **Product-market fit** can be one of the most difficult pieces of this puzzle and, especially with startups, the source of much agony, turmoil and potentially a company’s undoing. **UX wont save you alone
55.  Software that teaches you how to get better at the activity for which it is designed is what you shoudl strive for.

			Hopefully, for your users, finding what they are looking for is as enjoyable as the process of getting there.
57.  “You never change things by ﬁghting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”_ — R. Buckminster Fuller
58.  Challenge the Design System
59.  Match the tool to the problem; Sketches, Wireframes, and Prototypes
60.   >Sometimes we proclaim design to be art, sometimes science. This upsets both the artists and the scientists. Fortunately, it’s neither. We claim to understand human behavior, but are surprised by it daily. Despite what we say, there are wrong answers. The fold is a myth only when it suits us. And yes, criticism still stings. **So**, reluctantly, we lie. We lie because otherwise nothing would happen. We lie because we don’t have the words. We lie because we’re human. And being human is what it’s all about.
61.   Keep On learning
		1.   Find a mentor. Search out the best user experience design team in your area and apply for a job.
		2.   In addition, I would encourage you to read. Read everything and anything you can that relates to designing the user experience. Art, science, psychology, all types of design
62.   That’s the value of copywriting…an integral part of the user’s experience.
63.   “Kill your darlings. _After you back them up._"
64.   In conclusion, explaining people’s behavior on the web as simply “scanning” is too simplistic. Short text can be as poorly written as long text, and in some cases short text is less desirable than longer, well-written text.Writing well often means writing short text. But writing short text doesn’t mean you’re writing well. and people do enjoy longer texts
65.   [[Words are soul of User experience]]
66.   As UX designers, we have much to learn from the gaming industry. Delivering a top-notch design requires effort on a multitude of fronts, but we’ll find consistent success with an approach that begins with knowing our audience as deeply and confidently as Nintendo, Microsoft, and Apple.
67.   **Building a shared understanding** is not really about a specific process or tool or whether everyone can code or design. Having a shared understanding is about getting everyone to walk in the other person’s shoes a little. It’s about building respect, building vocabulary, and gaining enough insight to build solutions together that in the end make a better experience for our users. It’s how we build an experience right? We seek to understand our users. We observe them. We study them. How about doing the same with your co-workers?
68.   Make Decision Notes:  While this method requires a little more effort, it will actually save designers, engineers and others time and headache by eliminating the confusion around why a decision exists.
69.   [[HOW TO IDENTIFY THE BEST DESIGN PROBLEMS]]
70.   Instead of hiding or cutting stuff away, here is how we can achieve more meaningful simplicity in our designs:
		-   **Have a single core idea** (not several ideas, or a partial idea)
		-   **Improve clarity over time** (don’t overwhelm with inappropriate details)
		-   **Use consistency** (avoid using unnecessarily unique interfaces and messages)
 71.    A [[great user experience is important for long term success]]. But when business people start talking design it’s a good indicator that the playing field has changed.
