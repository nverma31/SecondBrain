## Shala Notes
1. "Policy" and "Public Policy" are broad terms; the former refers to some set of rules or guidelines for action, and the latter to such rules or guidelines when created and/or enforced by the state. For example, laws and regulations are public policies.  
  
2. Analysis refers to a) breaking a complex issue into simpler components (the opposite of synthesis); b) placing information in context. Policy Analysis is thus the field of evaluating policies, either in terms of their own stated or revealed objectives, or by comparison (placing in context) to some relevant reference point.  
  
3. Policy Analysts can work in a number of fields: it's a skill and/or a set of activities and outcomes, not a designation. Analysis is the base of the ADMEL+I Cycle: Analysis, Design, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning - with Learning feeding back into Analysis and Design - all arrayed around Implementation. This cycle also helps distinguish three categories of policy professionals: analysts & designers, implementation specialists (program / project managers), and M&E / organisational learning professionals. Fourth category (data gatherers / researchers) are invisible in this cycle, but no less important.  
  
4. Policy Analysts use a range of tools, which will be covered in greater detail throughout the course; it is important to note that models - one of the key tools - are a way to think about variables in the abstract, not a claim about reality in the world.  
  
5. Every analysis is, by definition, incomplete. They can still be accurate in a given context, or fit for purpose. One reason analyses are incomplete is data is unavailable, unusable, or unreliable. A second reason is that the effects of policy changes take time to play out, and are themselves affected by historical reasons (not all of which may be visible to the analyst).  
  
6. Analyses can also be inaccurate, in that they are affected by biases or fallacies. One major bias is the availability heuristic, which manifests as various forms of over-indexing on available information. The greatest fallacy in policy analysis is mistaking correlation for causation.  
  
7. General Equilibrium refers to the impact of a change (whether induced by a policy or otherwise) on an entire economy, i.e. on an interconnected network of markets. It cannot be observed in the short run, but some effects can be anticipated or predicted through analysis.  
  
8. More broadly, every desired outcome is not the result of a policy but the emergent outcome of a socio-political-economic-cultural system. A policy may attempt to shift some of the variables which are part of that system; whether it will succeed or not depends on a combination of the variables affected and others beyond the policy-implementer's control.  
  
9. Socio-political-economic equilibrium in a country can be understood in terms of critical ranges: every variable in the system needs to be within some range of values for order to result. A society's ability to restore variables to this critical range in case of any disruption can be understood as "homeostatic stamina" or "resilience".  
  
10. Policy change is thus a complex process requiring sustained effort - a marathon. Policy professionals should adopt an attitude of persistence tempered by intellectual humility, as an acknowledgment of the complexities, incompleteness, and the central role of politics in policy outcomes.

**CECAN Webinar: The Human, Learning, Systems approach to managing in complexity**

**Webinar Overview:** 
The webinar views the challenge of creating complexity-informed evaluation by seeing it as a public management challenge. **How can public management adopt a more complexity-informed approach?** **Outcomes are not easy to achieve because they are shaped by complexity of system** 

The session will outline an emerging complexity-informed approach to public management: t**he Human, Learning, Systems (HLS) approach.** The HLS approach involves public services responding to the variety of human need through bespoke service provision, using learning as the engine for performance improvement and stewarding the health of the systems which produce social outcomes.

**Human**

One of the three key tasks of managing work in an HLS way (including funding and commissioning of work) means creating the conditions in which people can build effective human relationships. 

This means understanding human variety, using empathy to understand the lives of others, recognising people’s strengths, and trusting those who do the work. **Variety, Empathy, Strengths and Trust (VEST)**.

**Learning**

In complex environments people are required to learn continuously in order to adapt to the dynamic, ever-changing nature of the work. In complex environments, there is no simple interventions which “works” to tackle a problem. “**What works” is an on-going process of learning and adaptation.** 

It is the job of managers to enable staff to learn continuously as the tool for performance improvement. This means using measures to learn, not for reward/punishment. It means creating the conditions where people can be honest about their mistakes and uncertainties. It means creating reflective practice environments between and across peer groups.

This requires funders/commissioners to fund for learning and adaptation, not for “results”.

**Systems**

The outcomes we care about are not delivered by organisations. **They are produced by whole systems – by hundreds of different factors working together.** The final job of managers is therefore to act as Systems Stewards – to enable actors in the system to co-ordinate and collaborate effectively - because that it was will enable positive outcomes to emerge.


**In service of Republic 1,2,3,6,7,8:**

1.  The first question in the field of public policy is: **What should the state do? A great deal of good policy reform can be obtained by putting an end to certain government activities, and by initiating new areas of work that better fit into the tasks of government.** The state has a monopoly of violence. All activities of the state are grounded in coercion: either directly (when the state demands that private. persons behave in certain ways) or indirectly (when the state uses threats of violence to collect tax revenues, and then spends them in certain ways). Coercion of private persons is the unique thing that only the state can do. Coercion is an unpleasant thing and can easily go wrong. Building the republic is about creating ethical control systems that contain and channel state violence for the common good. The founding intuition of the field of public policy is the notion that freedom works pretty well. Left to themselves, free men and women achieve reasonably good outcomes in most situations. Freedom works well most of the time, but there are exceptions: the four kinds of Ȍmarket failure’. These are: **Externalities, public goods, market power and asymmetric information.** On its own, the free market often fares poorly at dealing with these situations. This is where the state can add value in society, **by addressing market failure**. All states do some amount of redistribution. For example, relief work done by the government after a natural disaster is a case of transferring the money obtained in coercive ways (through taxation) from the populace to the affected people.
2.  The state can demand certain behaviour, and threaten violence against private persons who refuse to comply. The state can demand tax payments from the populace, backed by threats of violence against people who do not comply. The tax rates can vary based on the situation. Private persons overproduce things that impose negative externalities (such as pollution) and underproduce things that impose positive externalities; modifications to tax rates can help improve the outcome. The state can choose to spend tax revenues in two ways. It can run state organizations such as the police, which produce certain public goods. Or, it can transfer money to private persons. These transfers can be linked to market failure (e.g., using education vouchers to address the externalities in education) or they can be pure redistribution. The world of public policy is about these three levers: rules about behaviour, taxation, and spending money. These are generally grounded in laws that define the behaviour of government. Taxation and expenditure programmes are spelled out in the Finance Act, which constitutes the budget of each year. The Indian government often produces Ȍpolicy’ documents which do not mean too much.
3.  There is a long history of failure in the field of public policy. Over and over in history, we see governments that try to do things and fail. There is a **“law of unintended consequences’**, where an initiative often ends up inducing an outcome that is different from what was intended, and indeed was completely unanticipated. The state is a coercive agent. At the heart of market failure is a failure of coordination, of a lack of negotiation. There is a tension at the core, where problems of coordination are not easily solved through the tool of coercion. Some people might like to have a paternalistic government. Coercive power gives the state the ability to take from one and give to another, and this will make some people happy at the expense of others. Paternalism by the government is an impossibility.
4.  **People respond to incentives**. Human behaviour is not fixed; it changes when the incentives change. When policy changes, human behaviour changes. The behaviour of politicians and officials is also not fixed; it changes when the incentives change. There is nothing innately Indian about malfunctioning civil servants, politicians, mindset, or low state capacity. However, changing incentives should not be done in a simplistic way. When high-powered incentives are introduced, there is the danger of individuals pursuing those incentives to the exclusion of everything else. This can often result in unintended consequences. When incentives are established based on a certain statistical measure, there is a greater risk that this measure will be tampered with. While human beings mostly do well in understanding incentives and doing the best for themselves, the new field of Ȍbehavioural economics’ has documented many kinds of mistakes that human beings make in understanding information, risk and time.
5.  Supply and demand make the price. When prices go up, demand goes down. When prices go up, supply goes up. Free men and women will buy things where they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive, and thus arbitrage away pricing discrepancies. When there are large changes in a price in a short time, this can be disconcerting and impose problems upon some people. But if the government forces the price to change slowly, this makes things worse. Prices are the mechanism through which the market economy adjusts to shocks; by hindering price movement we postpone adjustment. In India, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary have all repeatedly undertaken actions which go against the grain of the price system. These actions are doomed to failure. When the policymaker tries to control the price, this is harmful, and the greatest harm is done when the policymaker tries to control both the price and the quantity. The policymaker should have no opinion on prices and not try to control prices. Policymakers must strengthen their intuition into the working of the price system, and go with the grain. **The field of public policy is about identifying and addressing market failure, not controlling prices.**
6.  The desire for vigorous creative destruction animates our interest in competition policy. All across the economy, we require a progressive outlook supporting entry and competition. Political economy generally favours the incumbent, and leads us towards stagnation where one industry after another are locked up by a few powerful incumbents. At present, Indian public policy does not give pride of place to competition policy. Far from always promoting competition, many state actions at present hamper competition. Policymakers must constantly use the power of the state to prise open closed systems, to create conditions of extreme competition, and to see the bright side of firm failure. The prolonged survival of a weak firm, based on artificial life support, induces negative externalities upon healthy firms. The exit of these Ȍzombie firms’ is a positive for the economy. It is likely that business cycle downturns will be shorter, once the bankruptcy process is fully in place. The Indian economy features the coexistence of high-productivity firms that abide by laws with low-productivity firms that violate laws. When law enforcement improves, and weak firms exit, GDP growth will be obtained through reallocation of labour and capital. **Creative destruction** is not alien to India: for small firms, it is the everyday reality. It is only with the large firms, and the areas connected with government, where competitive dynamics is poor.


**My Father's body at rest:**

-   Homeostatis is key for any organism and institution to maintain a default/normal range of working.
-   _My thoughts - The thesis forwarded here is that to keep a system going normally, it’s internal sub-components work tirelessly, not evident to us unless the system is mal functionally. The malfunctioning can highlight the internal processes. Self-correcting systems._
