# Price, Value and Cost

## Learning Outcomes
1.  Differentiate between the three essential concepts of Price, Value and Costs
2.  Link the concept of Value with Utility
3.  Understand the different types of costs that are used in Economic analysis

## Shala Notes
Concepts Covered: Price, Cost, Value, Economic Cost, Accounting Cost, Opportunity Cost, Transaction Cost, Sunk Costs, Marginal Cost.

1.  Price is the amount that one pays for a particular product or service which is determined exogenously. 
2.  Value is the intangible benefit from consuming a product. May or may not be equal to price. Value is closely related to benefit, utility and surplus. It is subjective in nature and differs from person to person.
3.  Economic Cost includes price + other non-monetary aspects such as time or energy spent.
4.  Economic cost is the sum of accounting /explicit and opportunity/implicit cost. 
5.  Accounting cost is the actual monetary cost incurred for any economic activity. 
6.  Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is foregone. If you have Rs 100 with which you either buy an ice-cream or a book - both of which cost Rs 100, and you choose to buy the book, then the opportunity cost of buying a book is that ice-cream that you missed. For a labourer whose wages are Rs 200 a day, opts for taking a day off work, the opportunity cost for one day off is Rs 200. 
7.  Opportunity cost depends upon the circumstances of the person or the firm, and may change with a change with circumstances. If the wages of the labourer increases to Rs 300 a day, his opportunity cost for a day off also rises similarly.
8.  The opportunity cost is not exactly the same as price paid for a good or the financial cost. For the labourer, there is no price of financial cost to be paid for taking a day off, but that does not mean that he is not bearing any costs for the day off.
9.  Transaction cost refers to the cost incurred while undertaking an economic activity.
10.  Transaction costs involve: Search and Information costs, Bargaining costs, Policing and enforcement costs
11.  Transaction costs are the resources given up for undertaking or completing an economic activity. For example, if you have to buy a button of a shirt that is sold at a price of Rs.2, but to buy which you need to go to market that is ten miles from your home and the taxi will charge you Rs 200 for it, then the transaction cost of purchasing a button is Rs 200. The total cost for buying the button for you would be Rs 200 (transaction cost) + Rs 2 (price of button).
12.  Transaction cost of an exchange (e.g. buying a button) is a real cost to society. It is there for the buyer as well as the seller. Higher the transaction cost, lesser is the incentive for that economic activity. Markets bring down the transaction cost and facilitate exchange of goods, thereby enabling people to exchange surplus - when that happens, there is an incentive for people to produce surplus - that in turn creates incentives for improving technology, innovation and overall economic development. High transaction costs can negate this process and lead to economic stagnation.
13.  A sunk cost is a cost that is already incurred which cannot be recovered. It is a one time expense that cannot be recovered once spent.
14.  Like other marginal concepts, marginal cost refers to the incremental cost due to an additional unit. Marginal benefit refers to the additional benefit you derive from consuming one additional unit of a commodity.

**Getting the Most out of Life: The Concept of Opportunity Cost**

-    [**Alfred Marshall**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Marshall.html) who called economics **“the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.”** This was the enterprise of Marshall and [**Adam Smith**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Smith.html) and [**Friedrich Hayek**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Hayek.html) and [**Milton Friedman**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Friedman.html): they tried to understand what people do and the implications of their behavior for the society at large.
-   _economics is the study of how to get the most out of life._ **Economics** is the study of infinite wants and finite means, the study of constrained choices. This is true for individuals and governments, families and nations. 
-   **Opportunity cost** is what you have to give up to get something.
-   Milton Friedman used to say that economics is simple. All you have to remember is that demand slopes downward and that nothing’s free. So one of the keys to thinking like an economist is always remembering that everything has a cost.
-   **_Sunk costs are sunk, historical costs are history._** Market prices ignore history. Opportunity cost is a forward-looking concept.
-   Perhaps the most important application of opportunity cost is the decision to do things for yourself vs. hiring someone.

 _Of all the constraints we face, the constraint of 24 hours in a day and a finite lifetime are ones we cannot escape. Getting the most out of life means using that precious time wisely. Using that time wisely means using and understanding opportunity cost_

  

**What is Opportunity Cost**

-   Opportunity cost refers to the value a person could have received but passed up in pursuit of another option.
-   Specialisations is important

**Price system**

-   Rose is a truly global product - Extensive complex system - global corporation by invisible hand

  

**Price Is a Signal Wrapped Up in an Incentive**

-   The incentive was if you can economise or build substitute.
-   Example - Importing roses, demand of chocolates
-   Most effective use of our resources - Price system
-   Prices not only convey information about goods and services, they also condense that information so that it is more useful to decision-makers. I ❜
-   A price is only informative if there are other prices against which you can compare it, because prices are a source of relative, not absolute, information about different goods and services.
-   information conveyed by market prices is necessary to determine how best to use scarce resources in production. The second states that a centralized planner can never acquire all of the information that is in the hands of decentralized economic actors, and that prices allow that information to be harnessed by individual decisionmakers.
-   ❛ The market is thus the focal point of the capitalist order of society; it is the essence of Capitalism. Only under Capitalism, therefore, is it possible; it cannot be “artificially” imitated under Socialism ❜
-   Private ownership, according to Mises, is essential for market forces to determine the prices for production inputs that will lead to those inputs’ most productive use
-   “the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place.” This is the sort of information that can only be acquired with experience and intimate contact with a specialized industry or locale ❜
-   ❛ Decentralizing the decision-making authority allows information on the particulars of time and place to be more fully utilized, but what about other types of information, information that is beyond most individuals

**CP23: Market Dynamics**

**Learning Outcomes**

1.  Understand the relationship between price and quantity supplied
2.  Recognise other factors that shape supply other than price
3.  Recognise the conditions under which production costs decrease with an increase in quantity produced due to the economies of scale and scope. 
4.  Understand Producer surplus
5.  Understand how the market clearing price is achieved and the factors that lead to changes in market equilibrium

  

  

-   Demand curve =. How much people want to buy based on price
-   Supply curve -How suppliers decide on supplying the product
-   Equilibrium Price =. Quantity demanded =. Quantity supplied

-   Market forces push toward the equilibrium price

-   Producer Surplus = diff b/w market price and min price sellers are willing to sell
-   A **consumer surplus** happens when the price that consumers pay for a product or service is less than the price they're willing to pay
-   Shortage

  

**NOTES**

**Concepts Covered:** Law of Supply, producer surplus, Supply function and shifts in the supply curve, Market equilibrium and changes in equilibrium quantity and price, Consumer and producer surplus at Equilibrium. 

1.  Supply is used to describe the quantity a producer is willing to produce for a given price. The **law of supply** states that, ceteris paribus, an increase in the price leads to an increase in the quantity supplied.
2.  Supply is the willingness of the producer / supplier to provide a good at given prices, and generally reflects the cost of producing/ supplying. He will not be willing to supply at a price that is lower than the cost (as it will not be viable). For a given supplier in the competitive market, the price is given (i.e. the price is decided by the interaction of numerous buyers and suppliers), hence he would keep supplying till the time his cost becomes equal to the market price.
3.  Supply curve is usually up-sloping in a free competitive market, when all the factors of production (capital, land, technology) and fully deployed. This happens because when all factors are fully deployed, then more factors can only be attracted by paying more. Another way of explaining this is that at higher prices, supplier of labour and capital will be willing to supply more labour and capital.
4.  S = f (Price, cost of production, technology, interest rate, competition in the market, etc).**The producer surplus is the difference between the market price and the seller’s least price at which they were willing to sell their products.**
5.  Market Equilibrium is the state where demand meets supply. It is reached by the free interaction of buyers and suppliers, evoking the concept of "invisible hand" described by Adam Smith. It is considered efficient in the sense that it is the state where the cost production equals the benefit of produce to the society (in monetary terms, as reflected by choice of people to buy or not).
6.  When the supply curve shifts right due to a reduced cost of production, it meets the demand curve at a new point giving a lower equilibrium price and higher quantity produced. When the demand curve shifts to the right due to increased incomes, it gives rise to higher prices and higher quantity produced.
7.  Economies of scale are the cost advantages faced by a firm when it produces in large quantities. The marginal cost of production keeps decreasing with an increase in quantity produced. 
8.  Economies of scale are enjoyed by a firm when an increase in the quantity of output is accompanied by a less than proportional increase in the quantum of costs.

  

  

 ### Exercise
1. Did the market forces work as expected? Was there movement along the curve or shifts in the curve?
There is an increase in demand not because of the price change but change in market forces. Shifts in the curve.. Supply curve actually 

2.How was the market equilibrium impacted? Did these goods reach a new equilibrium? Was there any external intervention that disturbed this equilibrium?

 3. Can you correlate the price changes with the elasticities of demand and supply for these products?

 

4.Is there a difference between a market equilibrium and a socially optimal situation?
