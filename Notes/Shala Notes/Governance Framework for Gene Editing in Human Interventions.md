# Governance Framework for Gene Editing in Human Interventions
##  Learning Outcomes

#### Part 1: Policy and Guiding Principles  
1. To situate technology differently from applications  
2. To understand why India needs to create its own frameworks for science and technology  adoption  
3. To understand the various risks and benefits of using emerging technologies  

#### Part 2: Frameworks for assessing and categorising applications  
1. To understand ethical and scientific considerations of gene editing  
2. To assess applications based on ethical and scientific considerations  
3. To categorise applications requiring different levels of governance  

#### Part 3: The ethics of gene editing: An Indian context  
1. It is important to derive an Indian version of ethics for using gene editing in an Indian  context.

#### **Discussion Questions:**  

#### Part 1: Policy and Guiding Principles  
1. What should be Indiaâ€™s position about promoting gene editing technologies?  
2. Why should India have a defined policy for gene editing?  
3. What are the principles India should follow when it comes to governing gene editing?  

#### Part 2: Frameworks for assessing and categorising applications  
1. Should India have a law or policy for gene editing governance?  
2. What ethical and scientific considerations should be thought of in the evaluation of gene editing?


#### Part 1: Policy and Guiding Principles  
1. India has high genetic disease burden coupled with a unique genetic history. Primary healthcare is weak and most medical expenses are borne out of pocket by citizens. In many places, basic facilities such as wheelchair access or proper footpaths are also not available aggravating the pain of debilitated persons. In this context, gene editing may  provide an important opportunity to treat genetic condition and improve human  productivity in India.  
2. However, the technology is still nascent and pre-mature release of applications may harm people and the environment. Further, the technology can also be used for   nefarious purposes such as creating bioweapons. Balancing the potential benefits and   risks of gene editing is the most important facet of any policy that promotes gene   editing in India.  
3. There are 4 core principles for development of framework for governing emerging  
technologies:  
 a. Technology and its applications must be used separately  
 b. Regulation is better than outright prohibition  
 c. Global and national interests should be balanced  
 d. Policymaking must be scientific and inclusive

  
Part 2: Frameworks for assessing and categorising applications

1. There are various scientific risks to using gene editing technologies in human - for  
example, off target editing or mosaicism - however, these can be mitigated by putting in  
place rigorous governance structures.  
2. Ethical considerations of gene editing on the other hand cannot be addressed through  
governance and include arguments of humans versus nature or tampering with genes of  
future generations without their consent.  
3. It is important to consider that promoting research is not the same as promoting human  
use of an application. India needs to develop the infrastructure and expertise to apply  
the technology, should its application become necessary in the future

  
Part 3: The ethics of gene editing: An Indian context  
1. Surveys in UK and US suggest that public are willing to accept gene editing as a medical  
tool in specific cases. In the context of India, no such study has been undertaken and  
therefore, the discussion on the ethics of gene editing itself remains limited and an  
outcome of an imported construct.
