2.  Understand how policy agenda is shaped
3.  Understand a few models of governmental decision-making

## Shala Notes

A common source of disappointment and frustration arises from the misunderstanding of government. A citizen or a technocratic policymaker often assumes that the government is a 'rational' animal, and makes decisions on the self-evident basis of benefits outweighing the costs. When this doesn't happen, as it often doesn't, there is disappointment, cynicism, and despair.

A government is not like an individual. A government is not even like a private firm or corporation that has well-defined shareholders, well-defined objectives and well-defined ways of doing business. These mental models are unsuitable to analyse and work with governments.

In addition to this, the government as an entity is an agent of the citizens, who are its principals.

Citizens are never homogenous. In India, diversity along every possible basis leaves it extremely difficult for citizens to form demands as 'principals'. This simultaneously allows the 'agent' (government) more space to do what is in its interests and also restricts its space to do other things. Can you think about practical instances where you can observe this?

There are several important and urgent issues that the government must take up. But what government takes up at any point might not easily square with what you think is urgent and important.

An important way in which agenda is shaped is through narratives. We will discuss this in a separate LU.

Consider the various ‘models’ of governmental decision-making summarised by Ayyar in Ch 6. Note that these are abstractions of reality. Don’t get too hung up over models. You should use them to help understand reality. Do not expect reality to conform to one or more of the models.

Here’s another model. Those of you who’ve studied physics at the high school level might immediately identify this (vector addition of forces to obtain a resultant). You can imagine a government decision to be the vector addition of various forces (each with a certain magnitude and direction). This can explain why most government decisions are compromises that are neither exactly what a policy consultant advises, nor what political constituents expect, nor entirely what the bureaucracy wants and nor entirely what the decision-maker herself intends.

The resultant a + b is pulling neither in a’s direction nor b’s. In public policy, there are numerous forces and the outcome can be seen as their vector sum) Do the following exercise once you have completed this week’s readings. 

1.  Can you identify when and how it first appeared on the public agenda?  
2.  How and how long did it then take to become an Act, Rule or Programme?  
3.  How did the government decide? Which model(s) best describes how the decision was made?
