#bookrecommendation Future Politics, [Jamie Susskind]

Six Models for the Internet + Politics (Fung et al)
1. empowered public sphere
2. displacement of traditional organizations by new digitally self-organised groups
3. digitally direct democracy
4. truth-based advocacy
5. constituent mobilisation,
6. crowd-sourced social monitoring

>“Reasoning from the character of political incentives and
institutional constraints, we argue that the first three revolutionary
and transformative models are less likely to occur than the second
three models that describe incremental contributions of technology
to politics.”
