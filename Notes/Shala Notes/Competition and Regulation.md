2.  Information technology is subject to large increasing returns to scale on both the demand and the supply side. Market outcomes in such industries will inevitably tend to be somewhat concentrated and require industry standardization and coordination. The resulting monopolies and standards will continue to attract the attention of government antitrust enforcers.
3.  Every company needs to know the rules of competition. Having a clear competition and other related laws, which are transparent and accessible is important. Companies are far better off anticipating antitrust challenges, both from private parties and from the government, when they fashion their strategy or plan an acquisition than if they are having to adjust their strategy later. 
4.  Companies have considerable freedom to engage in differential pricing. Versioning and differential pricing are effective tools for cost recovery in industries with large fixed costs and small marginal costs and are only rarely subject to antitrust attack.
5.  Competition policy should be intended to ensure a fair fight, not to punish winners or protect losers. If a company manages to dominate its market by offering lower prices and better products, it shouldn’t have anything to fear from the antitrust laws. By the same token, if a company loses out in a fair fight, antitrust laws shouldn’t exist to provide any comfort.
6.  All forms of Mergers and acquisitions involving direct competitors are subjected to careful review by competition authorities. To close a deal companies need to convince these agencies that the acquisition will not harm consumers.
7.  Companies can gain by cooperating with other companies to set standards and develop new technologies, so long as their efforts are designed to bring benefits to consumers. If companies can steer well clear of the antitrust hot-button areas of pricing and product introduction, and are genuinely working to establish and promote new and improved technologies, they are on solid ground and should be well protected from any antitrust challenge.
8.  Though the competition law in India explicitly prohibits predatory pricing, the method it uses to detect the unfair trade practice is inadequate in networked markets. When a firm is selling its products at a price lower than the marginal cost of production, it comes under the radar of the CCI for predatory pricing. However, since data on marginal cost is not easily available, the CCI uses average variable cost as a proxy for marginal cost. For platforms, however, there is usually high initial fixed cost and low variable cost thereafter. This enables many platforms to engage in predatory pricing, without grabbing the attention of the CCI. 
9.  Even though collusion, where rival firms enter into agreements to reduce competition, is seen unfavourably by the CCI, the competition law does not target common ownership of rival firms. The question of investor behaviour arises in situations where “the investors hold shares in competing companies, hence facilitating active collusion or reducing their incentives to compete; and in case of investor-facilitated buyouts that reduce the number of players in the market”
10.  Competition authorities will also have to look out for price parity clauses. Many platforms put in price parity clauses in its contracts with businesses that sell on the platforms. The online platforms often use their market power to “forbid companies from selling more cheaply elsewhere (including the seller’s own website, other platforms, and all offline distribution channels).
11.  Many technology platforms use their market power to engage in vertical integration, whereby the platform, which acts as a marketplace also, acts as a competitor on the very platform. E.g.: Amazon, the marketplace, and Amazon, the retailer, on the very same marketplace. After vertical integration, the platform has an incentive to exclude other competitors. This exclusion can be carried out explicitly through the delisting of certain suppliers from the platform or carried out more subtly in the form of higher commission fees to the supplier and through manipulation of rankings on the customer’s side.
