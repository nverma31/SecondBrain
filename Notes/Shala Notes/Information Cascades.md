## Shala Notes

 **An information cascade develops when people abandon their own information in favour of inferences based on earlier people’s actions**.

Ultimately, information cascades may be at least part of the explanation for many types of imitation in social settings. Fashions and fads, voting for popular candidates, the self-reinforcing success of books placed highly on best-seller lists, the spread of a technological choice by consumers and by firms, and the localized nature of crime and political movements can all be seen as examples of herding, in which people make decisions based on inferences from what earlier people have done. (Easley and Kleinberg, 2010). 
- [ ] **Check the reading from a classic** _ #bookrecommendation _Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World_  to understand this phenomenon better. Check section 16.7 in this reading which derives a few lessons based on information cascades. What inferences can you draw from these lessons as a policy change maker?

As changes in information technology are leading to more rapid coalescence of these types of herd behaviour, and that this is leading to a more unified global society in which there are more positive feedback loops, fewer natural checks on self-exacerbating mass phenomena, and a lower probability that things in any given sphere will tend towards an equilibrium rather than cycling wildly between various creative and/or disastrous extremes. (The Economist, 2011)

#### Parameters:

(a) There is a decision to be made – for example, whether to adopt a new technology, eat in a new restaurant, or support a particular political position.
(b) People make the decision sequentially, and each person can observe the choices made by those who acted earlier.
(c) Each person has some private information that helps guide their decision.
(d) A person can’t directly observe the private information that other people know, but he or she can make inferences about this private information from what they do.

1. Cascades can be wrong
2. Cascades can be based on very little information
But hey,
3. Cascades are fragile.

#### Breaking cascades:
- If each person can see what earlier people know as against what
they do.
- strategies for balancing this tension, potentially by forcing experts
to reach partial decisions independently before entering a phase of
collaboration and consensus.
- if certain people are known to have particularly good information
about a problem, it can matter whether they weigh in earlier in the
process or later.
