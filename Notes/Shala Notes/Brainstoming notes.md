 

**No region has the entire production stack** in its own territory since companies often specialize on particular process steps (design, fabrication, assembly) or technologies (memory chips, processors, etc.) in pursuit of economic efficiency. Ultimately, no region has achieved “strategic autonomy”, “technological sovereignty” or “self-sufficiency” in semiconductors.  
In fact, this value chain is characterized by deep interdependencies, high divisions of labor and close collaboration throughout the entire production process: US fab- less companies rely on Taiwanese foundries to manufacture their chips. The foundries themselves rely on equipment, chemicals and silicon wafers from the US, Europe and Japan. The semiconductor value chain is thus highly in- novative and efficient but not resilient against external shocks.

First, how to ensure access to foreign technology providers? Since any of the above-mentioned countries could disrupt the value chain through export control measures, foreign and trade policy plays a key role to ensure continued access to foreign technology providers. Second, how to build leverage by strengthening domestic companies through strategic in- dustrial policy? Since no region will be able to have the entire production stack within their own territory, governments should support their domes- tic semiconductor industry to maintain key positions within the value chain. Third, how to foster a more resilient value chain? In certain parts, such as contract chip manufacturing, the value chain is highly concentrated and needs to be diversified to lower geographical and geopolitical risks.

 

There are seven broad categories: memory, logic, micro, analog, optoelectronics, discrete and sensors.![[Screenshot 2021-11-16 at 08.33.31.png|300x300]]

The production process for semiconductors, and in particular ICs, consists of three distinct steps: design, fabrication and assembly and test.

Integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), such as Intel or Samsung, perform all three steps in-house.

Companies that only design chips and rely on contract chip makers for fabrication are called fabless. These companies lack a fabrication plant. Fabless companies, such as Qualcomm (US), Nvidia (US) and HiSilicon (China)

therefore, closely collaborate with foundries that manufacture chips in their fabri- cation plants (fabs). 
 
After the IC has been fabricated by the found- ry, the chip must be tested, assembled and packaged to protect it from damage. This last step is done either by the foundry itself or by outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) companies.

 
Roughly speaking, chip design is skill intensive with high research and devel- opment costs. Fabless companies typically spend 25% of their revenue on R&D. Chip fabrication is capital intensive because of expensive facility and equipment costs. Building a modern fab easily exceeds $ 15 billion. Assem- bly is labor intensive with lower profit margins. But it is not just that each production step is governed by varying business dynamics. Different semi- conductor technologies are also often produced by companies with certain business models.

-     DRAM: “short-term” memory for computing devices. Therefore, all DRAM vendors operate as IDMs.
-       The NAND market is essen- tially under the control of six vendors: Samsung and SK Hynix in South Korea, KIOXIA in Japan (WDC uses KIOXIA fabs) and Micron and Intel in the United States. (Figure 4) Similar to DRAM, NAND is a commodity where production volume and economies of scale are key. This is why DRAM vendors and NAND vendors typically operate as IDMs: The vendors take care of design, fabrication and assembly in-house
-        Thus, most devices that need electricity also de- pend on analog ICs. For performance gains, digital ICs depend on constantly improving production processes to fit more transistors on a square millim- eter of silicon.19 In contrast, analog IC vendors do not depend on shrinking production processes (nodes). These vendors are under much less pressure to invest in expensive cutting-edge manufacturing equipment than digital IC companies. Analog IC vendors depend on domain expertise because their products are designed for specific tasks in specific markets and various physical domains.
-         Both dynamics, the importance of domain expertise and the lack of pressure to invest in cutting-edge fabs, are why the analog IC market is far less concentrated than the memory chip or processor market.    The leading analog IC vendors are US American, European and Japanese IDMs. (Figure 5) Several of these IDMs follow a “fab-lite” business model. An IDM might rely on external foundries for the fabrication of certain chips, but not all.
-         Automotive Semiconductors:   European IDMs, such as Infineon, NXP, STMicroe- lectronics (ST) and Bosch, play a dominant role in the automotive industry (Figure 6) due to their strong domain expertise based on close connections to European car manufacturers and vertical in-tegration. Among the leading automotive IC suppliers are European, Japa- nese and U.S. American companies.
-          Processor Architectures: x86 for desktops, and ARM for mobile: Only Intel, AMD and VIA Technologies (Taiwan) hold the patents to produce and further develop x86-based processors.  As almost every personal computer is based on x86 processors, and the architecture is under full control of two U.S. companies, it is not surprising that China is looking for“homegrown” alternatives.
-           Intel (IDM) and AMD (fabless) develop and sell CPUs, but ARM Limited(UK) develops “blueprints” (IP) that other chip designers, such as Apple, Huawei and Samsung, use to develop and sell their own pro- cessors based on ARM’s IP.


>  Looking at various semiconductor technologies, the interdependencies be- tween different regions become obvious. Today’s ICT systems depend on DRAM from South Korea, NAND from Japan, analog chips from the United States and IP from Europe. No region has access to all important types of semiconductors within its own borders. Collaboration and close coopera- tion, combined with competitive pressure to innovate, led to today’s globally distributed, highly efficient and innovative semiconductor value chain. The necessary specialization and high division of labor also led to consolidated markets, oligopolies and even monopolies. This means that for several types of semiconductors there are only a few, sometimes just one, supplier. Losing access to these suppliers, due to natural disasters, pandemics or restric- tive trade policies, quickly disrupts the value chain.38 In addition, untangling these interdependent value chains comes at significant costs, and a loss of innovation and efficiency. One example is China’s effort to become self-suf- ficient by building fabs for memory chips (DRAM, NAND) and developing their own x86 processor.
