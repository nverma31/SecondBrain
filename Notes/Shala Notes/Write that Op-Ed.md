# Write that Op-Ed

## Learning Outcomes

This module helps you organise your thoughts and construct a structure for an article. And then, one building block at a time, write that Op-Ed.

## Shala Notes

1.  Opinion pieces and editorials are important tools to frame the larger public narrative surrounding a policy issue.
2.  An effective opinion piece draws on evidence and seeks to persuade the reader to build support for the writer’s viewpoint.
3.  Given that an Op-Ed is seeking to communicate a position on a specific issue, it is important to first explain the issue before outlining one’s viewpoint.
4.  Focus on language when writing opinion pieces, particularly the beginning to draw the reader’s attention and end to leave the reader with something to ponder. 
5.  Avoid jargon and technical terms. Keep it simple.
