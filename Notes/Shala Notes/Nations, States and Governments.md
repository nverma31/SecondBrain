 ##  Shala Notes
 
1.  A nation is "a large body of people united by common descent, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular state or territory" (OED). In Anderson's view, a nation is an "imagined community" forged together by the media.
2.  A family is the smallest political grouping. Clans, tribes, ethnic groups are progressively larger communities. A nation is the largest body linked by kinship, culture, and language.
3.  There are "imagined communities" that cut across national and territorial boundaries. E.g. The ideas of Christendom, the Islamic Ummah, the proletariat, the West, the South.
4.  To the extent that Anderson's argument about the media shaping "imagined communities" is right, we can expect modern technology to shape new imagined communities.
5.  See this video: [Rise of Netions by Nitin Pai.](https://youtu.be/tTJkCGlzQ8k/)
6.  [Read this article on the Politics of radically networked societies by Nitin Pai.](http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/nitin-pai-the-flash-mobs-of-class-warfare-111121900036_1.html). (Note: There's an error in the article. The argument is that this is not a classical class struggle)
7.  A state is "a nation or territory considered as an organised political community under one government" (Oxford English Dictionary). It is a political institution with certain characteristics that you will find described in your readings.
8.  A nation-state is one where there is a (large degree) of congruence between a nation and a state. Whether or not every community that thinks of itself as a nation should be entitled to its own state lies at the heart of the debate over "self-determination".
9.  Think about this (and you may wish to discuss it in the forums): What is more important? Liberty or self-determination? If a nation that achieves self-determination ends up as an authoritarian state, which is not an uncommon phenomenon, would it be better off being under colonial or federal rule where its nationals enjoy greater liberty? In other words, is self-determination overrated? [See On Liberal Nationalism by Nitin Pai.](http://acorn.nationalinterest.in/2008/09/04/on-liberal-nationalism/)
10.  A government is "the governing body of a state" and also "the system by which a state or community is governed". It is a political institution. The theory of "social contract" links the state (through the government) and the citizen.
11.  Here's an analogy: a state is like a corporation, and the government is like its management. The nation is like the body of shareholders.
12.  While "country" is commonly used to refer to a nation, state or nation-state, it more correctly denotes territory or land. Historically, nations and countries were congruent. The French nation mainly lived in a country called France. What would you say about the current day? Does the congruence hold? Why or why not? What are the consequences?



 ## My Notes
 
**Rise of Nations:**

-   Communities are imagined, same as Nations
-   _Online Communities are also imagines communities, they organise themselves politically, supra-national in nature._ _How will these be interacting with the existing Nation states?_

1.  in radically networked societies, it is extremely easy to mobilise large numbers of people. It takes a single text message, missed call or tweet to inform people about the time and place of protest
2.  Second, because these mobilisations do not depend on middle-level leaders who gather people on the ground, they are that much harder for the authorities to pre-empt. 
3.  Third, because these mobilisations take place in a networked fashion, they are many times faster than attempts at counter-mobilisation by hierarchically-structured authorities.

  

**Imagined communities:**

**On liberal nationalism**

-   Let’s start with an axiom: all individuals are free, and from this freedom, they possess certain inalienable rights. They possess these rights and freedoms at all times, but in a state of nature, their ability to enjoy the freedom and exercise the rights is circumscribed by their individual power. In Indian philosophy, the state of nature is termed as matsya nyaya, or the law of the fishes, a condition under which the stronger fish eats the weaker fish. To better enjoy their rights and freedoms, individuals trade-off a part of their freedom for the security offered by a state.the social contract is codified in a constitution. Constitutions are not, and do not have to be either perfect or immutable. To varying degrees, they affirm the rights of the individual and offer an enlightened method to settle the differences between the interests of individuals The upshot is that the state is necessary for the practical enjoyment of individual rights and freedoms. 
-   This is how **liberalism, nationalism and realism** are connected with each other. Liberalism (or libertarianism, in its American usage) is concerned about individual freedom. To enjoy freedom in practice, the individual gives up some of it to the state due to the concept of state of Nature. The state, a nation-state in India’s case, exists to ensure the rights, freedoms and well-being (yogakshema) of its people. So ensuring the survival and security of the Indian state—by maximising its relative power internationally—is wholly consistent with allowing its citizens to live in freedom
-   **Questions**: How can we derive certain inalienable rights from the premise that all individuals are free? I am also a bit confused about the fact the moment we have two individuals we can never have complete freedom

  

**Origin Type of state in India:**

**The Oxford companion: State**

-   **The state structure after independence**

-   Major institutional changes from universal suffrage for a sovereign legislature, president as head of state, a federal constitution, independent judiciary
-   Inherited the government apparatus of district administration, civil and criminal law, Armed forces.

-   **The Indian state in the 50s and 60s.**

-   A socialist outlook albeit with state focusing on industrialisation with a planned economy- precisely a mixed economy.
-   Congress in the states and in the center
-   Structural functional approach - consensus politics where states or local interest are brought to the foreground by their representatives to the Centre.
-   idea was now firmly established that the state was the principal, and in many instances the sole, agent of bettering the condition of the people and providing relief in times of adversity.

-   **The Indian state in 60s and 70s**

-   Congress losing its dominance in state
-   Regional politics taking center stage
-   Failure of the early economic dream
-   Schism in the Congress during Indira’s time, and she focuses on a state heavy model and more interventions aiming to play the electoral game to her advantage
-   Pranab Bardhan (1984) identified the capitalists, the rich farmers, and the bureaucracy as the three dominant classes, competing and aligning with one another within a political space supervised by a relatively autonomous state.
-   **The concept of Passive Revolution**

-   blocked dialectic. Power had to be shared between the dominant classes because no one class had the ability to exercise hegemony on its own. However, 'sharing' was a process of ceaseless push and pull, with one class gaining a relative ascendancy at one point, only to lose it at another, Kaviraj provided a synoptic political history of the relative dominance and decline of the industrial capitalists, the rural elites, and the bureaucratic-managerial elite within the framework of the passive revolution of capital.

-   80s and 90s

-   Economic reform
-   Creation of the civil society made up of the middle class relying on the newly formed corporate capitalist class and the so called political society made up by poor urban and rural classes, who need to organise themselves politically to direct state resources for their economic and social welfare.
-   **The state continues to be the most important mediating apparatus in negotiating between conflicting class interests, the autonomy of the state in relation to the dominant classes appears to have been redefined.**
-   Two ways to look at it - electoral mobilisation; usually done by the political society with political leaders emerging from it. And capitalist class with its hegemony on the civil society working with state for modernisation and economic growth.
-   Emergence of courts as defencders of normative and homogeneous civil society; BEFORE THE BJP.
