Hi Rama,Hope you are doing well.My name is Rohan, and I work as a Program Manager at The Takshashila Institution.I have been working on tech policy and data localization for the past year and have come up with an op-ed on the issue, the summary is below._Data is primed to be one of the most valuable resources in the 21st century. As the importance of big data increases, who owns the data and has access to it also becomes increasingly important. An increasing amount of countries are placing data on domestic soil in a quest to gain exclusive access to the resource. The question for India going forward is whether we should do the same and whether we can afford the costs of doing so._Would be grateful if you would consider publishing the same on The Print.The full piece is copied below, as well as a word doc attached with the same.Please let me know what you think!Best,  
Rohan
