#radicallynetworkedSocieties

## Definition

A Radically Networked Society is defined as a web of hyper connected  
individuals, possessing an identity (imagined or real), and motivated by a  
common immediate cause. The defining feature of an RNS is its scale of  
operation â€” wide reach and its ability to evade conventional national security  
measures. Read the Anatomy of Mobilisation in Radically Networked Societies for  
some hypotheses on this phenomenon.

##### Conclusion
- First, in radically networked societies, it is extremely easy to mobilise large numbers of people.
- Second, because these **mobilisations** do not depend on middle-level leaders who gather people on the ground, they are that much harder for the authorities to pre empt
- Third, because these mobilisations take place in a networked fashion, they are many times faster than attempts at **counter-mobilisation** by  hierarchically-structured authorities


### The three essential properties of RNS are:
i. The sociological aspect: Members of radically networked societies share a common imagined identity. They undergo socialisation processes such as internalising common myths in order to create and maintain in-group solidarity. 
ii. The political aspect: A radically networked society is capable of mobilising people based on a common immediate cause. This cause becomes a rallying point for protecting the group identity. 
iii. The network aspect: Perhaps the most important aspect of a radically networked society is its speed and scalability. Creation of an imagined identity and mobilisation for a cause are both proportional to the depth of the network. It is in this aspect that the Internet as a medium has thoroughly altered the way mobilisations occur
