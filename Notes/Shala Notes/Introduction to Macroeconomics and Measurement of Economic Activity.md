## Shala Notes

1.  Macroeconomics looks at the big picture – how does the entire economy work. It is a branch of economics dealing with the study of large scale or general economic factors.
2.  The principles of economics remain the same, but the scale is different. Prices are still determined by the interaction of the demand and supply curves. However, we are now looking at the aggregate price level determined by the interaction of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curve.
3.  Aggregate demand (or domestic final demand) is the total demand for the final goods and services in an economy at a given time. It tells us the amount of goods and services that will be purchased at different price levels.
4.  The aggregate of final goods and services produced in an economy is nothing but the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of an economy. Thus, aggregate demand is the demand for the GDP of a country.
5.  The aggregate demand curve shows the relationship between the price level in the economy and real GDP demanded, all other things constant.
6.  Similarly, aggregate supply is the total final goods and services that producers in a country are willing to sell at a given price level.
7.  The aggregate demand curve and the aggregate supply curve intersect to determine the equilibrium level of price and real GDP in the economy.
8.  National Income Accounting is a bookkeeping system that a government uses to measure the level of economic activity in a given time period.
9.  The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the most common measure of national income accounting that is used, is a monetary measure of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period.
10.  GDP is measured using three methods: The expenditure method, the income method and the value-added method. All three approaches should finally give the same number. The expenditure method sums up all spending on purchase of final goods and services produced in a given year. This is represented by the fundamental identity of the economy: Y = C + I + G + NX, where Y = National Income or GDP C = Consumption expenditure I = Investment expenditure G = Government Expenditure NX = Net Exports, that is Exports – Imports
11.  The Income approach simply adds up the total incomes earned by the factors of production in a given year. The Value added method is a slight modification to avoid double counting and sums up the value added at each stage of production. The value added at all stages sums to the market value of the final good, and the value added for all final goods sums to GDP.
12.  Inflation is an increase in the general price level in a country. Note that prices rising of a few products are not considered inflation. It specifically refers to an increase in the general price level. Inflation occurs when the aggregate demand is higher than the aggregate supply.
13.  Business cycles are often exacerbated by government action through fiscal and monetary policy
14.  Economic fluctuations are the rise and fall of economic activity relative to the long term growth trend of the economy. Economic fluctuations or business cycles are alternating periods of high and low economic activity, with corresponding fluctuations in income growth, production, inflation and unemployment rates. A typical business cycle has a prosperity and boom period, a recessionary period, and a depression at the trough. This is followed by a recovery phase, which leads to prosperity and boom.
15.  Inflation is measured in different ways. Policy makers in India look at the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the average price level of the most commonly consumed goods in the country.

**GDP:**

-   **Market value of all finished products produced within the country in a year**
-   **Capital goods(Yes), intermediate good(No)**
-   **Only counts production**

  

**RBI Paper : WPI and CPI**

-   The analysis conducted for the period 2007 to 2016 showed distinct episodes of divergence between CPI and WPI inflation. Decomposing the episodic bursts of divergence into various ‘effects’, the analysis shows that some index characteristic or effects create a seemingly permanent wedge between CPI and WPI inflation. Composition of food items and to some extent fuel items are seen to be largely
-   26 similar across CPIs and WPI. However, higher weight in CPIs for food items and their higher prices and variable trade and transport margins in the retail market compared to wholesale market, creates a permanent source of wedge in inflation between CPI and WPI.
-   However, episodes of spectacular divergence in CPI and WPI inflation are often caused by divergent movements in inflation of dissimilar items or scope effects. Scope CPI vis-à-vis scope WPI is seen to be sticky on account of non-tradable services related items; services as a component is absent in WPI. Instead, basic and intermediate commodities and industrial products, which are not included in CPI, from a sizeable share of scope WPI. These are largely internationally traded goods, with domestic prices closely linked to global commodity price cycles and by nature are volatile. High inflation in global non-food commodity prices, especially in the run up to the 2008 crisis, and the continuous rise again after a short-lived post-crisis collapse, led to sharp persistent increase in inflation in scope WPI items. This was, on a net basis, often masked by the high and sticky inflation in CPI scope items driven largely by non-tradable services including housing. Hence, in a period of rising commodity prices, these scope effects for WPI and CPI tend to more or less cancel out. However, whenever global commodity prices collapsed, as seen from the latter part of 2014 to the first half of 2016, scope WPI items registered persistent deflation, and ended up reinforcing scope CPI inflation. This, in addition to the ‘structural’ factors that would cause higher CPI inflation over WPI inflation – brought about by higher weight of food in consumption basket, dynamic margins in prices of retail over wholesale, and most importantly higher sticky inflation in non-tradables vis-à-vis tradables, resulted in CPI and WPI inflation to follow sharply divergent trajectories.
-   Going forward, scope WPI inflation could again show sharp increases depending on the degree of increase in global non-food commodity prices. At the same time, the scope CPI (i.e. items exclusive to CPI) inflation could also see further increases or at best remain at current levels on account of the sticky nature of services inflation and also considering the impact of the implementation of the 7th pay commission award on housing inflation. Even if the divergence between CPI and WPI at an aggregate level, at a point in time, turns out to be zero, the analysis points out that this is more of an unstable “knife-edge” equilibrium rather than an enduring process brought about by congruence of underlying factors. These observations have large implications on the choice of appropriate index for monetary policy formulation. **First, it reinforces the appropriateness of the adoption of CPI** (the allIndia CPI-combined) inflation as the nominal anchor for monetary policy formulation in India recently. The analysis brings out the inherent price stickiness in CPI scope items and its importance in explaining inflation divergence. Hence, along the lines of Aoki (2001), for monetary policy purposes, scope CPI-combined carries more information on the most persistent price components or underlying inflationary pressures and inflation expectations. Furthermore, given the growing evidence of persistence in food and fuel prices and its importance for understanding underlying inflation (Cashin et al., 2016), C**PI offers a better way for capturing its transmission to non-food non-fuel categories, given the finding that food items and to a lesser extent fuel items exhibit considerable similarity between CPIs and WPI.**

  

  

**Measuring GDP:**

-   Final Demand or Expenditures Approach

-   Investment
-   Exports and Imports
-   Government spending
-   Adjusting for inflation

-   Gross domestic Income

-   Compensation
-   Corporate profits
-   Other capital types Incomes
-   Adjusting for inflation

-   Value-added or Production Approach

-   Annual value estimate
-   Real Value Added, Gross Output, and Intermediate Inputs

-   **Problems**

-   One problem that concerned Kuznets and his team—the lack of adequate data measuring the services sector—is still important ❜
-   ❛ A second set of challenges relates to the development of better estimation methods for components that are, by their nature, difﬁcult to value ❜
-   ❛ The Bureau of Economic Analysis is also expanding its coverage of intangibles, such as research and development, which are not generally bought and sold in the marketplac ❜
-   ❛ Finally, pressure for providing data on national income more quickly will only increase. Given the already heavy reliance on extrapolation in producing the advance GDP estimates, it is unlikely that the estimates can be made available much faster ❜
