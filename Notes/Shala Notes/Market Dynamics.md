## Shaöa  Notes

**Concepts Covered:** Law of Supply, producer surplus, Supply function and shifts in the supply curve, Market equilibrium and changes in equilibrium quantity and price, Consumer and producer surplus at Equilibrium. 

1.  Supply is used to describe the quantity a producer is willing to produce for a given price. The **law of supply** states that, ceteris paribus, an increase in the price leads to an increase in the quantity supplied.
2.  Supply is the willingness of the producer / supplier to provide a good at given prices, and generally reflects the cost of producing/ supplying. He will not be willing to supply at a price that is lower than the cost (as it will not be viable). For a given supplier in the competitive market, the price is given (i.e. the price is decided by the interaction of numerous buyers and suppliers), hence he would keep supplying till the time his cost becomes equal to the market price.
3.  Supply curve is usually up-sloping in a free competitive market, when all the factors of production (capital, land, technology) and fully deployed. This happens because when all factors are fully deployed, then more factors can only be attracted by paying more. Another way of explaining this is that at higher prices, supplier of labour and capital will be willing to supply more labour and capital.
4.  S = f (Price, cost of production, technology, interest rate, competition in the market, etc).The producer surplus is the difference between the market price and the seller’s least price at which they were willing to sell their products.
5.  Market Equilibrium is the state where demand meets supply. It is reached by the free interaction of buyers and suppliers, evoking the concept of "invisible hand" described by Adam Smith. It is considered efficient in the sense that it is the state where the cost production equals the benefit of produce to the society (in monetary terms, as reflected by choice of people to buy or not).
6.  When the supply curve shifts right due to a reduced cost of production, it meets the demand curve at a new point giving a lower equilibrium price and higher quantity produced. When the demand curve shifts to the right due to increased incomes, it gives rise to higher prices and higher quantity produced.
7.  Economies of scale are the cost advantages faced by a firm when it produces in large quantities. The marginal cost of production keeps decreasing with an increase in quantity produced. 
8.  Economies of scale are enjoyed by a firm when an increase in the quantity of output is accompanied by a less than proportional increase in the quantum of costs.

**Treasure Island**

-   The textbook story of this transformation is that the Fishers have a comparative advantage in fishing. Though they are better than the Palmers at both water collecting and fishing, the **Fishers have a comparative advantage at fishing.** They are relatively better at fishing than they are at collecting water, compared to the Palmers. Notice that there are two senses of comparative in the previous sentence—we are comparing fishing to water collecting and the Fishers to the Palmers. Comparative advantage has no meaning in a one-good world or in a one-family economy.
-   **It is better for the Fishers to produce water by what I call the roundabout way—by fishing and swapping the fish for water.** Similarly, the Palmers have a comparative advantage in collecting water.People have been assigned to the tasks that lead to the greatest output where “greatest” takes into account the importance of extra protein relative to diminished water.
-   **The simple answer is specialization**. The lesson of comparative advantage is that while anything we do is worth doing well, not everything we do well is worth doing. Not everything we do well is worth doing. The most productive use of one’s time depends on the skills that others can provide. But it also depends on the value of those skills. The existence of prices and wages makes it possible to answer these impossible questions. Prices and wages emerge as we trade with one another. They are a by-product of trade. But the prices and wages are in turn what make trade so powerful in an economy with millions of people doing millions of tasks. Prices and wages help us decide what to produce via trade—the roundabout way—and what to produce on our own—the direct way. 

-   Trade creates wealth. Self-sufficiency is the road to poverty.
-   The specialization we see in the world around us is the result of trade. We would do very different tasks and be much poorer if we limited either foreign or domestic trade
-   The truly scarce resource in our lives is time and trade allows us to leverage our time and productivity in extraordinary ways by cooperating with others
-   Not everything we do well as individuals or as a nation is worth doing
-   Whether what we do well is worth doing, depends on the skills and desires of those around us. What is wise and productive in one time and place may not be wise and productive in another.

  

  

  

**LECTURE NOTES:**

  

**Notes**

1.  There are generally two forms of exchange: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary exchange is called trade and involuntary exchange is theft or appropriation. Trade has the potential to make everyone better off. People trade because they benefit from it. People trade to further their self-interest. Individual maximization of self-interest leads to overall social welfare. **It involves the movement of resources from a low-value use to a high-value use.**
2.  Trade allows each person to specialize in the activities he or she does best, i.e., at the lowest cost. By trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost.
3.  A person who is undoubtedly the best at something is said to have an absolute advantage. **However, we engage in activities where we have a comparative advantage.** It is possible to have an absolute advantage in an activity, but not comparative advantage.
4.  A person or a country is said to have a comparative advantage in an activity if they can produce a good or service at a lower cost. Virat Kohli may be one of the best batsmen in the country and has an absolute advantage in batting. He might also be the fastest typist in the country, giving him an absolute advantage at that too. Does he have a comparative advantage in both activities? The answer is no!
5.  If Kohli took time off from batting to do his own typing, then he sacrifices the large amounts of money he gets from entertaining cricket fans the world over (high opportunity cost). However, if he hires a typist who might be sacrificing a similar or lower paying job (lower opportunity cost), then it is the secretary who is the lower-cost typist. Thus, Kohli has a comparative advantage in batting and the secretary has a comparative advantage in typing and it makes economic sense for Kohli to hire and pay wages to the secretary and focus on his batting.
6.  Countries also trade based on their comparative advantage. A country can have an absolute advantage in many things, but it will produce goods in which it has a comparative advantage in and trade with other countries who have specialized in their own comparative advantage. The moral is this: **To find people's comparative advantages, do not compare their absolute advantages. Compare their opportunity costs.**
7.  For an excellent exposition on comparative advantage, read “Treasure Island: The Power of Trade. Part I. The Seemingly Simple Story of Comparative Advantage” by Russ Roberts on Econ Lib, given as a reference here.
8.  A barrier to trade is a government-imposed restraint on the flow of international goods or services.
9.  **The most common barrier to trade is a tariff—a tax on imports.** Tariffs raise the price of imported goods relative to domestic goods (goods produced at home).
10.  Another common barrier to trade is a **government subsidy to a particular domestic industry**. Subsidies make those goods cheaper to produce than in foreign markets. This results in a lower domestic price. Both tariffs and subsidies raise the price of foreign goods relative to domestic goods, which reduces imports.
11.  Yet another barrier to trade is an embargo—a blockade or political agreement that limits a foreign country's ability to export or import.
12.  Barriers to trade are often called "**protection**" because their stated purpose is to shield or advance particular industries or segments of an economy. From an economic perspective, though, the costs to the economy almost always outweigh the benefits enjoyed by those who are protected.
13.  For a more detailed exposition regarding protectionism, please read the attached note titled “Popular Myths Regarding Protectionism”
14.  Generally, any barriers to trade end up creating a deadweight loss to the economy.
15.  Do note that barriers to trade often emerge due to reciprocity. If one economy levies a tariff against another economy, this can cause retaliation and soon this will lead to a race to the bottom situation with competitive trade barriers that ends up hurting every country involved. The same applies to situations where governments give subsidies to private manufacturers in order to make them competitive in the world market. The WTO trade agreements disallow protectionist measures by countries. It also clamps down upon trade moves such as dumping, which occurs when manufacturers export a product to another country at a price below the normal/domestic price. The objective of dumping is to increase market share in a foreign market by driving out competition and thereby create a monopoly situation where the exporter will be able to unilaterally dictate price and quality of the product.
