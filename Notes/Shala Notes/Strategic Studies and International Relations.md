## Shala Notes

**Nature and Character of Strategy**

1.  Grand strategy is the direction and use made of any or all of the assets of a security community, including its military instruments, for the purposes of policy as decided by polity.
2.  Military strategy is the direction and use made of force and the threat of force for the purposes of policy as decided by politics.
3.  Strategy is the only bridge built and held to connect policy purposefully with the military and other instruments of power and influence.
4.  Strategy serves politics instrumentally by generating net strategic effect.
5.  Strategy is adversarial; it functions in both peace and war, and it always seeks a measure of control over enemies (and often over allies and neutrals, too).
6.  Strategy usually requires deception, is frequently ironic, and occasionally is paradoxical.
7.  Strategy is human.
8.  The meaning and character of strategies are driven, though not dictated and wholly determined, by their contexts, all of which are constantly in play and can realistically be understood to constitute just one unified super-context.
9.  Strategy has a permanent nature, while strategies (usually plans, formal or informal, expressing contingent operational intentions) have a variable character, driven but not mandated by their unique and changing contexts, whose needs are expressed in the decisions of individuals.

**Making Strategy**

1.  Strategy typically is made by a process of dialogue and negotiation.
2.  Strategy is a value-charged zone of ideas and behaviour.
3.  The making of strategy should always be informed by an understanding gleaned from overt and covert sources of Intelligence. This necessary activity must be ever alert to the perils of disinformation created by adversaries.
4.  Historically specific strategies often are driven, and always are shaped, by culture and personality, while strategy in general theory is not.

**Executing Strategy**

1.  The strategy bridge must be held by competent strategists.
2.  Strategy is more difficult to devise and execute than are policy, operations and tactics: the making and conduct of strategy inevitably create friction of all kinds.
3.  The structure of the strategy function is best explained as comprising political ends, chosen ways and enabling means (especially, but not exclusively, military), and the whole endeavour is informed, shaped, and may even be driven, by the reigning assumptions, both those that are recognized and those that are not.
4.  Strategy can be expressed in strategies that are: direct or indirect; sequential or cumulative; attritional or manoeuvrist–annihilating; persisting or raiding (more or less expeditionary); or a complex combination of these alternatives.
5.  All strategies are shaped by their particular geographical contexts, but strategy itself is not.
6.  Strategy is an unchanging, indeed unchangeable, human activity in thought and behaviour, set in a variably dynamic technological context.
7.  Unlike strategy, all strategies are temporal. Strategy is logistical.
8.  Strategic theory is the most fundamental source of military doctrine, while doctrine is a notable enabler of, and guide for, strategies.

**Consequences of Strategy**

1.  All military behaviour is tactical in execution, but must have operational and strategic effect, intended and otherwise.

-   Micro and macro strategy to grand strategy and pure strategy


**Clausewitz Puzzle prologue:** 

-   Firstly, On **War could only be understood with regard to Clausewitz’s examinations of the conduct of war in his own times.**Although Clausewitz was an admirer of Napoleon for most of his life, in his final years, he recognised the theoretical significance that arose from the diﬀrent historical outcomes that followed
-   There are four fundamental contrasts between the early and later Clausewitz that need to be emphasised, because they remain central to contemporary debates about his work:
-   **The Trinity, with all its problems, is the real legacy of Clausewitz**: Trinity that the first of its three tendencies mainly concerns the people, the second mainly concerns the commander and his army, and the third mainly concerns the government.
-   While Clausewitz emphasises explicitly that the three tendencies of his Trinity are ‘variable in their relationship to one another’ and that no arbitrary relationship between them should be fixed.
-   Looking more closely at his formula, we can see that he describes war as a continuation of politics, but with other means than those that belong to politics itself
-   These two parts of his statement constitute two extremes: war described either as a continuation of politics, or as something that mainly belongs to the military sphere. Clausewitz emphasises that policy uses other, non-political means. This creates an implicit tension, between war’s status as a continuation of policy, and the distinctive nature of its other means…
-   **Current developments seemed to indicate a departure from interstate wars**, for which Clausewitz’s theory appeared to be designed, and the advent of a new era of civil wars, non-state wars, and social anarchy. Sun Tzu’s The Art of War seemed to oﬀer a better understanding of these kinds of war, because he lived in an era of never-ending civil wars.1…
-   And this is exactly the problem. Sun Tzu’s The Art of War, as well as the theoreticians of SIW and fourth generation warfare, lack the political dimension with respect to the situation after the war. 16They concentrate too much on purely military success…One might win battles and even campaigns with Sun Tzu, but it is diﬃcult to win a war by following his principles. The reason for this is that Sun Tzu was never interested in shaping the political conditions, because he lived in an era of seemingly never-ending civil wars…
-   **But the main problem is that both McNeilly and Sun Tzu neglect the strategic perspective of shaping the political-social conditions after the war and their impact ‘by calculation’ on the conduct of war. As mentioned before, this was not a serious matter for Sun Tzu and his contemporaries…**
-   **The relevance of Clausewitz’s implicit dialectical conception for philosophical problems.**

**Planning**

Planning is a disciplined problem-solving process with clearly defined outputs in terms of Ends, Ways and Means. Seeks to create certainty by accounting for all the pertinent variables, determining the cause and effect relationships and addressing each through ends, ways and means.

-   German and right after the Napoleanic ears. Prussian and have a practical understanding as well as theoretical.

3.  **Theory and Practice of War**

-   Theory helps but its only supplementary to the practice as WAR is volatile, ambiguous, Uncertain. We need geniuses with both theoretical grounding and artistry. 

5.  **Ends and Means of War**

-   Ends political and should be victory and total annihilation of the enemy, means the strongest army which can deliver.

7.  **Limited and absolute War**

-   Strategist should aspire for the “ideal” absolute war
-   Theory of suspension of action

9.  **Legacy of Clausewitz**

-   The best strategy in short was to be very strong; ﬁrst generally and then at the decisive point.

  

**Little book on Big Strategy**

At the highest level of strategy, the nation-state has interests that it pursues to the best of its abilities through the use of the instruments of power. Policy articulates the reﬂection of these interests in the strategic environment. In pursuing its policies, the state confronts adversaries and other actors, while some factors simply remain beyond control or unforeseen. Strategy, acting within the conﬁnes of theory, is a method of creating strategic effects favorable to policy and interests by applying ends, ways, and means in the strategic environment. In doing this, strategy has an inherent logic that can be understood as a theoretical construct and applied in the development and consideration of strategy at all levels.

Strategy applies in the realm of the strategic environment which is characterized by greater or less degrees of chaotic behavior and complexity—VUCA. The environment can be addressed at different levels of strategy. It has external and internal components, i.e., the international environment and the domestic environment, respectively. Rational and irrational choice, chance and probability, competitors, allies, and other actors are all part of the strategic paradigm.

Strategy is fundamentally a choice; it reﬂects a preference for a future state or condition in the strategic environment. It assumes that, while the future cannot be predicted, the strategic environment can be studied and assessed. Trends, issues, opportunities, and threats can be identiﬁed with analysis, and inﬂuenced and shaped through what the state chooses to do or not do. Thus strategy seeks to inﬂuence and shape the future environment as opposed simply to reacting to it. Strategy at the state level can be deﬁned as:

  

The art and science of developing and using the political, economic, social-psychological, and military power of the state to create strategic effects that protect or advance national interests in the environment in

accordance with policy guidance. Strategy seeks a synergy and symmetry of objectives, concepts, and resources to increase the probabilities and favorable consequences of policy success and to lessen the chances of policy failure.

  

**Assumptions and Premises of Strategy.**

1. Strategy is proactive and anticipatory but not predictive. Strategy seeks to promote or protect national interests as the future unfolds. In doing this, it must consider change and make assumptions. Both change and assumptions are bounded by existing facts and realistic possibilities. Strategy is clear on what are facts, assumptions, and possibilities.

2. Strategy is subordinate to policy. Political purpose dominates all levels of strategy. Policy ensures that strategy pursues appropriate aims in an acceptable manner. However, the development of strategy informs policy; policy must adapt itself to the realities of the environment and the limits of power. Thus, policy ensures that strategy pursues appropriate aims, and strategy informs policy of the art of the possible.

3. Strategy is subordinate to the nature of the environment. Strategy must identify an appropriate balance among the objectives sought, the methods to pursue the objectives, and the resources available within the particular strategic environment. Strategy must be consistent with the nature of the strategic environment.

4. Strategy maintains a holistic perspective. It demands comprehensive consideration. Strategy is developed from a thorough consideration of the strategic situation and knowledge of the nature of the strategic environment. Strategic analysis highlights the internal and external factors in the strategic environment that help deﬁne strategic effect and the speciﬁc objectives, concepts, and resources of the strategy. Strategy reﬂects a comprehensive knowledge of what else is happening within the strategic environment and the potential ﬁrst-, second-, and third-order effects of its own choices on the efforts of those above, below, and on the strategist’s own level.

5. Strategy creates a security dilemma for the strategist and other actors. Any strategy, once known or implemented, threatens the status quo and creates risk for the equilibrium of the strategic environment.81 The strategist must determine if the end justiﬁes the risks of initiating action, and other actors must decide whether to act and in what manner.

6. Strategy is founded in what is to be accomplished and why it is to be accomplished. Strategy focuses on a preferred end state among possible end states in a dynamic environment. It provides direction for the coercive or persuasive use of the instruments of power to achieve speciﬁed objectives, thereby creating strategic effects leading to the desired end state. The strategist must comprehend the nature of the strategic environment, the policy, and the nation’s aggregate interests to determine what strategic effect is necessary before proper objectives can be determined.

7. Strategy is an inherently human enterprise. It is more than an intellectual consideration of objective factors. The role of belief systems and cultural perceptions of all the players is important in the development and execution of strategy.

8. Friction is an inherent part of strategy. Friction cannot be eliminated, but it can be understood and accounted for to a greater or lesser extent.

9. Strategy focuses on root purposes and causes. This focus makes strategy inherently adaptable and ﬂexible. Strategy learns from experience and must be sufﬁciently broad and ﬂexible in its construction to adapt to unfolding events and an adversary’s countermoves. Strategy’s focus on root causes and purposes ensures that direction of subordinate levels is sufﬁciently broad to be adaptable and ﬂexible.

10. Strategy is hierarchical. Just as strategy is subordinate to policy, lower levels of strategy and planning are subordinate to higher levels of strategy. The hierarchical nature of strategy facilitates span of control.

11. Strategy exists in a symbiotic relationship with time. Strategy must be integrated into the stream of history; it must be congruous with what has already happened and with the realistic possibilities of

the future. Small changes at the right time can have large and unexpected consequences. Consequently, an intervention at an early date has greater effect at less cost than a later intervention. Strategy is about thinking and acting in time in a way that is fundamentally different from planning.

12. Strategy is cumulative. Effects in the strategic environment are cumulative; once given birth, they become a part of the play of continuity and change. Strategies at different levels interact and inﬂuence the success of higher and lower strategy and planning over time.

13. Efﬁciency is subordinate to effectiveness in strategy. Strategic objectives, if accomplished, create or contribute to creation of strategic effects that lead to the achievement of the desired end state at the level of strategy being analyzed. In that way, they ultimately serve national interests. Good strategy is both effective and efﬁcient, but effectiveness takes precedence over efﬁciency. Concepts and resources serve objectives without undue risk of failure or unintended effects.

14. Strategy provides a proper relationship or balance among the objectives sought, the methods used to pursue the objectives, and the resources available. In formulating a strategy, the ends, ways, and means are part of an integral whole and work synergistically to achieve strategic effect at that level of strategy, as well as contribute to cumulative effects at higher levels. Ends, ways, and means must be in concert qualitatively and quantitatively, internally and externally. From the synergistic balance of ends, ways, and means, the strategy achieves suitability, acceptability, and feasibility.

15. Risk is inherent to all strategy. Strategy is subordinate to the uncertain nature of the strategic environment. Success is contingent on implementation of an _effective_ strategy—ends, ways, and means that positively interact with the strategic environment. Failure is the inability to achieve one’s objectives, the thwarting of achievement of one’s objectives by other actors or chance, or the creation of unintended adverse effects of such magnitude as to negate what would otherwise be regarded as strategic success.

  

**Ends, Ways, Means.**

Strategy is expressed in terms of ends, ways and means. Ends, ways, and means that lead to the achievement of the desired end state within acceptable bounds of feasibility, suitability, acceptability, and risk are valid strategies for consideration by the decisionmaker.

_Objectives (ends)_ explain “what” is to be accomplished. They ﬂow from a consideration of the interests and factors in the strategic environment affecting the achievement of the desired end state. Objectives are bounded by policy guidance, higher strategy, the nature of the strategic environment, the capabilities and limitations of the instruments of power of the state, and resources made available. Objectives are selected to create strategic effect. Strategic objectives, if accomplished, create or contribute to creation of strategic effects that lead to the achievement of the desired end state at the level of strategy being analyzed and, ultimately, serve national interests. In strategy, objectives are expressed with explicit verbs (e.g., deter war, promote regional stability, destroy Iraqi armed forces). Explicit verbs force the strategist to consider and qualify what is to be accomplished and help establish the parameters for the use of power.

_Strategic_ 

_concepts (ways)_ answer the big question of “how” the objectives are to be accomplished by the employment of the instruments of power. They link resources to the objectives by addressing who does what, where, when, how, and why, with the answers to which explaining “how” an objective will be achieved. Since concepts convey action, they often employ verbs in their construction, but are actually descriptions of “how” the objective of a strategy is to be accomplished. Strategic concepts provide direction and boundaries for subordinate strategies and planning. A strategic concept must be explicit enough to provide planning guidance to those designated to implement and resource it, but not so detailed as to eliminate creativity and initiative at subordinate strategy and planning levels. Logically, concepts become more speciﬁc at lower levels.

_Resources (means)_ in strategy formulation set the boundaries for the types and levels of support modalities that will be made available for pursuing concepts of the strategy. In strategy, resources can be tangible or intangible. Examples of the tangible include forces, people,

equipment, money, and facilities. Intangible resources include things like will, courage, spirit, or intellect. Intangible resources are problematic for the strategist in that they are often immeasurable or volatile. Hence, intangible resources should always be suspect and closely examined to determine whether they are actually improperly expressed concepts or objectives. The rule of thumb to apply is that resources can usually be quantiﬁed, if only in general terms. The strategist expresses resources in terms that make clear to subordinate levels what is to be made available to support the concepts.

  

**Validity and Risk.**

  

Strategy has an inherent logic of suitability, feasibility, and acceptability. These would naturally be considered as the strategy is developed, but the strategy should be validated against them once it has been fully articulated. Thus, the strategist asks:

  

Suitability—Will the attainment of the objectives using the instruments of power in the manner stated accomplish the strategic effects desired?

  

Feasibility—Can the strategic concept be executed with the resources available?

  

Acceptability—Do the strategic effects sought justify the objectives pursued, the methods used to achieve them, and the costs in blood, treasure, and potential insecurity for the domestic and international communities? In this process, one considers intangibles such as national will, public opinion, world opinion, and actions/reactions of U.S. allies, adversaries, and other nations and actors.

  

The questions of suitability, feasibility, and acceptability as expressed above are really questions about the validity of the strategy, not risk. If the answer to any of the three questions is “no,” the strategy is not valid. But strategy is not a black and white world, and the strategist may ﬁnd that the answer to one or more of these questions is somewhat ambiguous.

  

**Risk** is determined through assessment of the probable consequences of success and failure. It examines the strategy in its entire logic—ends, ways, and means—in the context of the strategic environment, and seeks to determine what strategic effects are created

by the implementation of the strategy. It seeks to determine how the equilibrium is affected and whether the strategic environment is more or less favorable for the state as a result of the strategy. Risk is clariﬁed by asking:

-   What assumptions were made in this strategy, and what is the effect if any of them is wrong?
-   What internal or external factors were considered in the development of the strategy? What change in regard to these factors would positively or adversely affect the success or effects of the strategy?
-   What ﬂexibility or adaptability is inherent to the components of the strategy? How can the strategy be modiﬁed and at what cost?
-   How will other actors react to what has been attempted or achieved? How will they react to the way in which the strategy was pursued?
-   What is the balance between intended and unintended consequences?
-   How will chance or friction play in this strategy?
