### Reading1: Not enough people are paying attention to this economic trend
- The second assumption this chart makes is that the total cost of production increases as supply increases
- Software doesn’t work like this. Microsoft might spend a lot of money to develop the first unit of a new program, but every unit after that is virtually free to produce. Unlike the goods that powered our economy in the past, software is an intangible asset.
- If you want to understand why this matters, the brilliant new book #bookrecommendation _Capitalism Without Capital_ by Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake is about as good an explanation as I’ve seen.

- Haskel and Westlake outline four reasons why intangible investment behaves differently:

1.  **It’s a sunk cost.** If your investment doesn’t pan out, you don’t have physical assets like machinery that you can sell off to recoup some of your money.
2.  **It tends to create spillovers that can be taken advantage of by rival companies.** Uber’s biggest strength is its network of drivers, but it’s not uncommon to meet an Uber driver who also picks up rides for Lyft.
3.  **It’s more scalable than a physical asset.** After the initial expense of the first unit, products can be replicated ad infinitum for next to nothing.
4.  **It’s more likely to have valuable synergies with other intangible assets.** Haskel and Westlake use the iPod as an example: it combined Apple’s MP3 protocol, miniaturized hard disk design, design skills, and licensing agreements with record labels.




### Shala Notes
1.  Essentially, anything that can be digitized—encoded as a stream of bits—is information. For our purposes, baseball scores, books, databases, magazines, movies, music, stock quotes, and Web pages are all information goods.
2.  Economists say that a good is an experience good if consumers must experience it to value it. Virtually any new product is an experience good, and marketers have developed strategies such as free samples, promotional pricing, and testimonials to help consumers learn about new goods. But information is an experience good every time it's consumed. How do you know whether today's Watt Street Journal is worth 75 cents until you've read it? Answer: you don't. 
3.  A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention. Nowadays the problem is not information access but information overload. This has lead to the development of personalised advertising based on data collected through various means. This new, one-to-one marketing benefits both parties in the transaction: the advertiser reaches exactly the market it wants to target, and consumers need to give their attention only to ads that are likely to be of interest. 
4.  Of course, information is costly to create and assemble. The cost structure of an information supplier is rather unusual. Information is costly to produce but cheap to reproduce. Books that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce can be printed  for a dollar or two, and 100-million dollar movies can be copied on videotape for a few cents. Thus, it involves high fixed costs, but low marginal costs. This can be called as “first-copy costs”. 
5.  This cost structure leads to substantial economies of scale: the more you produce, the lower your average cost of production. But there's more to it than just economies of scale: the fixed costs and the variable costs of producing information each have a special structure. The dominant component of the fixed costs of producing information are sunk costs, costs that are not recoverable if production is halted.
6.  **This cost structure has many important implications on the pricing of products. A marginal cost based pricing just does not make sense (as MC~0). Thus, pricing is based on consumer value. Since people have widely different values for a particular piece of information, value-based pricing leads naturally to differential pricing. **
7.  This also has implications on the market structure for information goods. There are only two sustainable structures for an information market:
	1.  The dominant firm model may or may not produce the "best" product, but by virtue of its size and scale economies it enjoys a cost advantage over its smaller rivals
	2.  In a differentiated product market we have a number of firms producing the same "kind" of information, but with many different varieties. This is the most common market structure for information goods: the publishing, film, television, and some software markets fit this model.

8.  Product Personalisation: The extreme end of product differentiation is to personalise the product to each customer based on their needs and it is easier to do this for information goods than any other type of good. Personalisation creates the maximum value for each customer and then, differentiated pricing extracts as much of this value as possible. 
9.  Price discrimination: Three main types of price discrimination: 
	1.  Personalized pricing: Sell to each user at a different price.
	2.  Versioning: Offer a product line and let users choose the version of the product most appropriate for them.
	3.  Group pricing: Set different prices for different groups of consumers, as in student discounts.

10.   While we are increasingly witnessing personalised products, first degree price discrimination or personalised pricing is still not as prevelant. There are four reasons why you might want to sell to groups rather than directly to end users:
		1.  Price sensitivity: If members of different groups systematically differ in their price sensitivity, you can profitably offer them different prices. Student and senior citizen discounts are prime examples.
		2.  Network effects: If the value to an individual depends on how many other members of his group use the product, there will be value to standardizing on a single product. Microsoft has exploited this desire for standardization with its Microsoft Office suite.
		3.  Lock-in: If an organization chooses to standardize on a particular product, it may be very expensive for it to make the switch owing to the costs of coordination and retraining. Again, Microsoft serves as the obvious example.
		4.  Sharing: In many cases it is inconvenient for the individual user to manage, or organize all information goods that he or she will want to consume. Information intermediaries such as libraries or system administrators can perform this coordination task.

11.  Products can be versioned along a variety of dimensions: Delay, user interfaces, speed of operation, format, capability, features, comprehensiveness, annoyance, and support are some examples.
