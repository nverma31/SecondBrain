## Notes
- Mass consumption of the same information can form new identities. New nations can be manufactured. Information flows can have far-reaching consequences on the natureof politics. Information can disrupt nations, states, governments, and societies.
- States mirrors corporations. And in corporations, information flows are optimised towards hierarchical production
- [[Radically networked society]]
- Information age geopolitics differs from industrial age geopolitics.
- We are in an information age: there’s wide availability of information without a commensurate change in the cognitive abilities of individuals.
- Human affairs have been transformed. Between individuals. Between individuals and institutions. Between institutions.
- Major implications for representative democracy
- Mobilisation by radically networked societies beats counter mobilisation by hierarchical states
- Nature of negotiations changes
- **Terrorism in the information age** works when the audience identifies with the terrorists’ cause, and fails when it sympathises with the victims. As long as there were media gatekeepers and editorial norms, coverage could be shaped to make the audience generally sympathise with the victims, if not feel repulsed by the terrorists. But now, the terrorist can, inexpensively, take his case directly to a worldwide audience.
