## Shala Notes

A narrative is essentially a "story". Read this interesting Marxist Take on Narratives.  
  
The policymaking process takes place with the context of multiple narratives. Some narratives might be in conflict with each other at times. Some may reinforce each other at times.  
  
At any given time:  
  
(a) there might be a number of contesting narratives in disequilibrium,(b) a number of narratives might be in stable equilibrium and (c) there might be one or a few narratives that are dominant.  
  
What does this imply? That it is important to assess your policy proposal in the context of the narrative dynamics. Is your proposal consistent with the current narratives? Does it challenge or destabilize the current narrative? Does it introduce a new narrative? Does it risk being seen as part of an existing/old narrative?  
  
An astute assessment of the narrative dynamic is perhaps the zeroth step in towards successfully introducing policy changes.  
  
POLITICAL NARRATIVES Varshney identifies three master narratives at the national level. Read Ch3 of his book (see recommended readings above) for a more detailed analysis of the master narratives and what they mean for Indian politics. You'll find other narratives implicit in chapters of the OCPI (Ch 11 Gender and Politics, Ch 12 Regionalism and Secessionism, Ch 24 Social Justice, Ch 26 Farmer's movements).  
  
Who shapes these narratives? Commonplace (and usually inaccurate answers) are: "The West", "Capitalists", "Imperialists", "Communists", "Congress Party", "the Sangh Parivar", "the Media", "JNU", "the intellectual class", "History" and so on.  
  
One way to understand narrative formation: there is usually a source or sources, this is then modulated by others, and then amplified and 'broadcast' by yet others. There may be people who repeat it and modify it according to their own interests. This happens over time and space. Serendipity might play as important a role as wilful design.  
  
The upshot is that narratives involve different actors, possibly with different interests, across time. For instance, Tilak's attempt to shape a robust nationalist response to British colonial rule might well lie at the root of the today's Hindutva narrative. The persistence of Marxist ideology in very different times, geographies and social contexts is another example. So too the Congress party's embrace of communal-caste-based identity politics within a narrative of social justice.  
  
However, it is possible for a small group of actors to create a narrative surge. The anti-corruption movement of 2011 in India is a good example. Both corruption and the Lok Pal bill have been around for decades. The narrative of corruption being an evil is also very old. Big scandals like the ones around Commonwealth Games and 2G spectrum have been seen in the past. Yet anti-corruption and Lok Pal was the big narrative of 2011. [OPTIONAL] Can you identify the source, modulators, amplifiers & broadcasters of the 2011 Lok Pal narrative? Use the discussion forum.  
  
Just as there are grand narratives at the national level, there are grand narratives at the state and local government levels.  
  
POLICY NARRATIVES Like what they say about movies (that all movies are variations of a handful of basic plots), policy narratives are also variants of a few archetypes. Deborah Stone's chapter on "Symbols" outlines some important ones.  
  
As Stone says "Policy stories are tools of strategy. Policy makers as well as interest groups often create problems (in the artistic sense) as a context for the actions they want to take. This is not to say they actually cause harm and destruction so they will have something to do, but that they represent the world in such a way as to make themselves, their skills and their favorite course of action necessary."  
  
This is not dissimilar to marketing strategy, where the consumer is made to recognise the necessity of the product, before being sold it.  
  
Getting the narrative right is important and difficult in practice. This is partly because the policymaker usually arrives at the problem definition & solution through the prism of his/her own narrative. Adapting one's own narrative to an objective assessment of the extant narrative scenario is not easy for many reasons. (What might these reasons be?). As discussed in Week 2, dispassion helps.  
  
In the second half of CP101 you will deal with quantitative methods. Very few policy debates are won solely on the basis of narrow rationality of facts and figures. A convincing narrative might carry the day even if the solution it offers is absolutely counterproductive. But a convincing rational argument might not see the light of day in the absence of a satisfactory narrative. Policymakers without an academic background in mathematics and science might focus narratives.  
  
Those who are comfortable with numbers and graphs might focus on logic & numerical calculations. However, a good policymaker should aim for "the right narrative and the right solution".  
  
Watch Pratap Bhanu Mehta's lecture at the Takshashila GCPP Workshop for a political context in which the narrative dynamics are taking place. PBM Part2  
  
STRATEGY There are many 'models' or 'frameworks' that can be used to effect change. As usual do not get too hung up over the models. They are merely tools to help you conceptualise the environment, work out a strategy, find levers that you can use and implement your plan.  
If you have not already done so, review Devesh Kapur's chapter on the political economy of the state (Ch 29, OCPI) and Ayyar's chapter on policy processes (Ch 3, PPI). You must have a good understanding of the policy landscape and the political economy in order to better appreciate and apply the techniques we discuss this week.  
India's old system of public administration will be increasingly unable to deal with the demands of governing a modern economy. This will create space for domain experts & technocrats who will need to be accommodated into the system. The institution of an "OSD" is currently used for this purpose. We should expect government to be more open to outsiders if only for the reasons of necessity.  
Ergo, it is important to explore how one's own position in the system can be leveraged to expand one's policy influence.  
(People often end up expanding their 'office political' influence, without expanding their policy influence). (Watch Prof Bibek Debroy's lecture at the Takshashila GCPP Workshop on reforming bureaucratic processes, below)

  
MANAGEMENT OF POLICY CHANGE In Ch 9 of PPI, Ayyar identifies some practical considerations to incorporate in your strategy to effect policy change.  
If you are a manager of a government department or PSU, your main challenge is to work with your colleagues, subordinates and 'stakeholders' to get your organisation to implement something. Core management skills you learn in the private sector are applicable and useful â€” with some important changes. For instance: Profit (or profit alone) is not usually a motive & a yardstick to assess performance. Hiring, firing and procurement is not as simple as it is in private firms. Culture can be very different.  
Organisational power is often distributed differently. See the report by Mader, Kellman and Myers (HKS & BAH) for one way of handling the managerial challenges. How different are they compared to what you'd see in a large private corporation? You can discuss this in the forum.
