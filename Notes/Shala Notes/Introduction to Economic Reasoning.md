##  Shala Notes
**Concepts Covered:**

Rationality, Utility, Resource Scarcity, Trade-offs, Thinking at the margin, Positive and normative analysis, Micro vs. Macroeconomics., Indifference Curves and budget constraints 

1. Economic theory is conventionally divided into micro and macroeconomics. Microeconomics involves a study of the decision making, interaction and responsiveness, of individuals, households and firms, to a set of choices available to them.

2. Macroeconomics is the study of aggregates, such as, national income, unemployment rate, total consumption, total investment, government expenditure and revenue, and international trade and the microeconomic tools such as demand (D) and supply (S). 

3. Positive analysis concerns what is, and normative analysis deals with what ought to be. In principle, positive states can be tested through systemic empirical evidence and statistical techniques.

4. Understanding the role of value judgments in the trade-offs involved and in choices made is vital to public policy making.

5. The two main definitions of economics are: - a study of how a society uses its limited resources to produce, trade, and consume goods and services; and second, study of incentives and choices facing the economic agents, and the manner of coordination of their decisions and activities.

6. People are assumed to be rational, i.e. given the choice they will make the best use of their resources. Such rationality is very high when it comes to simple decisions, e.g. whether to buy apples or oranges, but in case of complex issues this rationality can become constrained by the lack of information, lack of capacity to analyze and other factors.

7. Further assumptions of rationality are completeness, transitivity, and independence

8. A rational economic agent always maximises his **marginal** utility. Marginal is the additional utility that one gains by consuming one extra unit.

9. An Indifference curve captures the choice that individuals face. It shows the various combinations of goods that gives you the same level of satisfaction. 

10. The point of tangency between the indifference curve and the budget line shows the equilibrium combination of any two goods.

# 8 Fold Path to Economic Reasoning

1.  Not Yes or No, But More or Less. Think not if a policy is good or not, but think whether it will make things better or not. Pareto Optimality Principle. Will a policy make more people better-off than worse off
2.  Incentives Matter
3.  Trade can make everyone better of
4.  Thinking at the margin 
5.  Cost comes from scarcity : Cost is the sum total of all resources that are given up in order to acquire a good or service. Transaction Costs, if high, can hamper economic activity. 
6.  Consider both costs and benefits
7.  Growth is the best way out of poverty: The only way to increase a nation’s real income is to increase its real output. Improving output requires increasing productivity of the population. This will increase long term potential and real output. 
8.  Balance between markets, government, and society: Economics is a fine balance between what markets, government, & society do. The best way to organise economic activity is by leaving it to the markets. But, important to note that markets can fail. Government intervention can sometimes make market outcomes more efficient. Not always. Can make situation worse

## **Readings Lecture 1:**

  

**Predictably Irrational or Predictably Rational?**

-   Behavioralists then dismiss much modern economic analysis as misleading, if not totally wrongheaded, and suggest that the better way to predict economic behavior is through surveys and experiments on how people actually make decisions.[**4**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2010/McKenzierational.html?highlight=%5B%22rationality%22%5D?new_tab=1#footnote4) Because they are so easily replicated, laboratory experiments are the “fruit flies” of social science, enabling the experimenters to conduct a frame-by-frame analysis of what people do, not what economists deduce they do.
-   People, including economists, are imperfect decision makers because of their mental limitations. But this fact does not mean that markets fail. Indeed, markets do far more than induce improved allocation of resources, given wants and resources. Markets induce market participants to be more rational than they otherwise would be because they must pay a price for being irrational. Thus, markets allow—no, require—economists to assume that people are more rational than they are likely to be found to be in laboratory settings, absent meaningful information and incentives and absent market pressures.

  

**Incentives Matter:**

-   Despite a common belief that economics is about money, non-monetary incentives can be just as important as monetary incentives in affecting behavior. Time is one important non-monetary factor in what we do.
-    Adding time to the list of incentives isn’t enough either. People care about their reputation and fame and their conscience. They care about glory and patriotism and love. All of these can act as incentives. 
-   But what the economist really means is that holding everything else constant—the amount of fame or shame, glory or humiliation—and increase the monetary reward, and people will do more of it. Lower the monetary reward while holding those non-monetary factors constant and people will do less of it. **Economists often focus on monetary incentives because they are observable and usually easier to change than non-monetary incentives.**
-   The role of incentives plays a critical role in the way that individuals treat their own property relative to the property of others or communal property.
-   **Incentives can be negative and positive**

  

**Think on the Margin**

-   Thinking on the margin is also key to deciding the optimal amount of something to buy or the optimal amount of an activity to engage in. Take crime. Assume that we all agree (I realize that we don’t) about which activities should be criminalized and which should not. Would it make sense to eliminate all crime? Thinking on the margin leads to the conclusion that it does not. If we allocate resources efficiently, we will go after the crimes that are most beneficial to prevent and least costly to go after. But some crimes would not be very beneficial to prevent and would be costly to prevent. Imagine, for example, trying to prevent all petty shoplifting. The marginal cost of preventing such crimes would exceed the marginal benefit. So the optimal amount of crime is greater than zero
-   **If you think at the margin, you are thinking about what the next or additional action means for you.**  If an hour extra work weeding means you will get 12 more tomatoes, then one additional hour results in 12 additional tomatoes. Economists summarize that by saying your **marginal product of labor** is 12.   **marginal cost** of a producing one additional tomato is 5 additional minutes 
-   **Thinking at the margin** means to let the past go and to think forward to the next hour, day, year, or dollar that you expend in time or money.
-   You can’t change the past, but you _can_ change what you do next. (Economists sometimes summarize this by saying, **“Sunk costs are sunk.”**) And in what you do next, you should weigh the [**costs and benefits**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/costbenefitanalysis.html) starting afresh for the next few minutes of your time
-   Economists say your marginal pleasure or **marginal utility**–your marginal benefit–**diminishes** as you experience more.
-   The term “marginal cost” is not the same as [**opportunity cost**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/opportunitycost.html). Opportunity cost is from the perspective of a buyer, while marginal cost is from the perspective of a seller or producer. That is, opportunity cost refers to what you have to sacrifice–at the margin–as a buyer because when you buy one thing you can’t buy something else. **Marginal cost** refers to what a seller or producer has to sacrifice in order to sell or produce one more item
-   If you enjoy math, you might find it helpful to see that in economics the word “marginal” means the derivative or slope of a curve. It’s the additional cost or benefit that derives from a very small change.
-   Why are diamonds more expensive than water? Prof. Mario Villarreal-Diaz answers this question using what economists call marginal analysis.
-   Every patient gets the same lecture: “If you don’t floss, you’ll loose your teeth. I told you this last time, and you’re still not flossing!” Has it ever occurred to dentists that the marginal benefit of flossing may be less than its marginal cost?…  
      
    

**Slavery, Snakes, and Switching: The Role of Incentives in Creating Unintended Consequences**

-   People don’t always respond to incentives in the ways you might predict. What distinguishes good economic thinking from bad is recognition of the subtle, creative, and often unforeseen ways that people respond to incentives. Ignoring the complex operation of incentives is a recipe for unintended consequences.
-    The Bad Assumption of Fixed Behavior
-   **Switching Effects**: New rewards and punishments do not affect only the targeted activity. They can also affect the level of other, related activities. Punishing one “bad” thing can induce people to do more of other bad things; rewarding one “good” thing can induce people to do less of other good things.
-   Rewarding (or Punishing) the Wrong Thing: For a reward or punishment to be effective, it also must aim at the right target
-   The key insight—which applies to all kinds of goods and services, not merely gasoline—is that people do not only make choices about prices and quantities. There are many, many margins of choice that people can exploit to improve their situations and to evade regulations.
-   The important lesson for policymakers is that regulations will almost always have unintended consequences, because creative people continually find ways to exploit margins of choice that were not considered by the regulators.
-   A good economist realizes that human beings are imaginative and clever. They change their behavior in response to incentives in both predictable and unpredictable ways, constantly seeking to improve their lives in light of new conditions.

  

**Benefit-Cost Analysis**

-   Whenever people decide whether the advantages of a particular action are likely to outweigh its drawbacks, they engage in a form of benefit-cost analysis (BCA).
-   Implicit in this statement is a central tenet of BCA: the effects of a policy change on society are no more or no less than the aggregate of the effects on the individuals who constitute society. 
-   It is equally important to note that benefits and costs, even though they are almost always expressed in dollar terms in BCA, go well beyond changes in individuals’ incomes.

  

**Economic Growth**

-   for operations such as compounding that depend on repeated multiplication, we systematically underestimate how quickly things grow
-   Economic growth occurs whenever people take resources and rearrange them in ways that make them more valuable.  
-   We consistently fail to grasp how many ideas remain to be discovered. The difficulty is the same one we have with compounding: possibilities do not merely add up; they multiply. 
-   If a poor nation invests in [**education**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Education.html) and does not destroy the incentives for its citizens to acquire ideas from the rest of the world, it can rapidly take advantage of the publicly available part of the worldwide stock of knowledge.
-   A poor country like India can achieve enormous increases in standards of living merely by letting in the ideas held by companies from industrialized nations.
-   Giving firms tighter patents and copyrights over new ideas would increase the incentives to make new discoveries, but might also make it much more expensive to build on previous discoveries. Tighter [**intellectual property**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IntellectualProperty.html) rights could therefore be counterproductive and might slow growth.
-   The one safe measure governments have used to great advantage has been subsidies for education to increase the supply of talented young scientists and engineers. They are the basic input into the discovery process, the fuel that fires the innovation engine
-   The challenge now facing all of the industrialized countries is to invent new institutions that encourage a higher level of applied, commercially relevant research and development in the private sector.
-   here are, however, two safe predictions. First, the country that takes the lead in the twenty-first century will be the one that implements an innovation that more effectively supports the production of new ideas in the private sector. Second, new meta-ideas of this kind will be found.

  

  

 **The Ten Pillars of Economic Wisdom**

By David R. Henderson

1. TANSTAAFL: There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.

2. Incentives matter; incentives affect behavior.

3. Economic thinking is thinking on the margin.

4. The only way to create wealth is to move resources from a lower-valued to a higher-valued use. Corollary: Both sides gain from exchange.

5. Information is valuable and costly, and most information that’s valuable is inherently decentralized.

6. Every action has unintended consequences; you can never do only one thing.

7. The value of a good or a service is subjective.

8. Creating jobs is not the same as creating wealth.

9. The only way to increase a nation’s real income is to increase its real output.

10. Competition is a hardy weed, not a delicate flower.
