2.  Strength in the standards game is determined by ownership of seven critical assets. The key assets are (1) control of an installed base, (2) intellectual property rights, (3) ability to innovate, (4) first-mover advantages, (5) manufacturing abilities, (6) presence in complementary products, and (7) brand name and reputation.
3.  The purchase price of software is minor in comparison with the costs of deployment, training, and support. This is especially true in the case of corporate purchases of software. 
4.  When you find yourself falling behind in a network industry, it is tempting to cut the price to spur sales, a tactic we call survival pricing.
5.  Survival pricing doesn’t work, it just signals weakness
6.  If you fall behind, target a market niche or interconnect with the larger network. 
7.  Build the opportunity costs of lost sales into your access prices or licensing fees.
8.  Allow competitors, and even rivals, to participate in developing standards, but on your terms.
9.  If the demand for your product grows too fast, too many of your resources may end up being devoted to meeting current demand rather than investing in R&D for the future.
10.  Developing proprietary extensions is a valuable tactic to recapture at least partial control over your own technology.
