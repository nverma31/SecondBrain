## Shala Notes

**Concepts covered:** 

Tax incidence, deadweight loss, price ceiling and price floors, tariff and quotas, Minimum wages and rent controls. 

**Tasks:**

1. Try to apply the concept of deadweight loss and tax incidence to the import tariffs.

**Notes:**

1.  A Price ceiling is an artificial price point much lower than the actual market price that would have emerged. It is often set by the government for political purposes in order to keep prices affordable. 
2.  The ceiling will naturally result in a demand and supply mismatch. At lower prices, fewer firms will be willing to supply at that price. This results in shortages and consequently rationing of the products.
3.  Systemic shortages will also lead to underground economies, where suppliers will be willing to sell at higher prices. This will lead to loss of revenue for the government in terms of foregone taxes. 
4.  One of the most consistent examples of price ceilings imposed in many nations are rent controls. Rent control, like all other government-mandated price controls, is a law placing a maximum price, or a “rent ceiling,” on what landlords may charge tenants.
5.  There are two types of rent controls: hard and soft. Soft rent controls permit an automatic percentage of rent increase in a year tied to inflation rates, and provide many other provisions for landlords to ease the burden of regulations. However, a hard rent controls puts an inflexible fixed ceiling, which is applicable without exemptions. 
6.  Price Floor is an artificial price point set at a much higher price than the market outcome. This is again set by a government authority in order to encourage certain producers, who are traditionally considered to be vulnerable. 
7.  Minimum support prices in India and many other agricultural subsidies are examples of price ceilings. MSP or the procurement price in India stipulates the minimum price that is to be paid to the farmers by the government while procuring their produce. This often leads to a situation of excessive supply, such as the sugarcane market. High MSP for sugarcane in India has resulted in excessive supply of sugarcane and lower supply of other commodities with MSPs.
8.  Both price ceilings and floors result in distortions in the market, in terms of shortages or excess supply, and create distortions in allocation of resources. 
9.  Due to the shortages or excess supply, there will be a deadweight loss in the economy. In the case of a price ceiling, some of the producer surplus will be appropriated by the consumers, but not the entire amount. Some of the surplus is lost, which is known as deadweight loss. The opposite happens in a price floor: producers appropriate some of the consumer surplus, but not all. 
10.  Tax incidence is said to "fall" upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of, or ultimately has to pay, the tax. The key concept is that the tax incidence or tax burden does not depend on where the revenue is collected, but on the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply. A tax also usually creates deadweight loss in the economy. 
11.  Government interventions in markets can have many unintended consequences. A price floor/ceiling can lead to underground economies. A government ban on a product can lead to huge distortions in the market.
