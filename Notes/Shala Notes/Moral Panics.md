# Moral Panics

### Shala Notes

> The concept Moral Panics refers to a situation in which public fears and state interventions greatly exceed the objective threat posed to society by a particular individual or group who is/are claimed to be responsible for creating the threat in the first place (Scott Bonn, PsychologyToday). #bookrecommendation  This concept was first introduced by Stanley Cohen in his book by the same name


>A widespread fear, most often an irrational one, that someone or something is a threat to the values, safety, and interests of a community or society at large.

**Concern** – There must be the belief that the behaviour of the group or activity deemed deviant is likely to have a negative effect on society.
**Hostility** – Hostility toward the group in question increases, and they become "folk devils". A clear division forms between "them" and "us".
**Consensus** – Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there
must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the "moral entrepreneurs" are vocal and the "folk devils" appear weak and disorganised.
**Disproportionality** – The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.
**Volatility** – Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative
