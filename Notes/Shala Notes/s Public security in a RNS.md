# Liberty & Security in Radically Networked Societies: A Challenge for Every Generation

#### Questions
1. how should the hierarchical Indian state respond to the challenges of a networked society?
2. how can the Indian state respond to this challenge in a way that upholds national security while also protecting individual freedoms?
3. what will be the exact nature of the trade-off between liberty and security in an age of radically networked societies?

### Conclusion
*This chapter demonstrated how radically networked societies — webs of connected individuals, possessing an imagined identity and motivated by a common immediate cause, raise new questions regarding the liberty—security trade-off in the Indian context. As the Indian state tries to frame answers to these new questions, the chapter argued that liberal democratic republics should follow three principles — longer public debate cycles on privacy laws, avoiding the trap of hardcoding laws and avoiding prior restraints on the freedom of speech and expression.*
