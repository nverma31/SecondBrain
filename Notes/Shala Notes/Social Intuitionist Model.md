# Social intuitionist Model

### Shala Notes
Intuitions come first, reasoning comes after that.

Haidt’s model suggests that intuitions (gut feelings based on automatic thought processes) come first, and moral reasoning comes second. These are separate processes, the proof of which is when people are left morally dumbfounded.

This doesn’t mean that people have the same intuitions. Moral domain varies according to culture. It is narrower in individualistic cultures. People have gut feelings, particularly about disgust and disrespect that drive reasoning. Morality can’t be entirely self-constructed.

Nor does it mean that intuitions cannot be changed. There is a social intuitionist model proposed. You need to target a person’s intuition rather than attack the other’s reasoning.

Another work on these lines has been done by Joshua Greene. In his book Moral Tribes, he proposes that cooperation did not evolve for universal application. Morality thus solves the problems between “Us” and “Me” but it cannot solve the problem of “Us” vs “Them”. For that, we need to rely on more effortful reasoning.
