# Policy Simulation Exercise


[[Semiconductor Exercise]]


###  Step 1: Problem Definition
1. Be as precise as possible.
2. Narrow down the scope of research – by geography, different aspects
of the problem, time scale, etc.
3. Think in terms of degrees and not absolutes.  (Avg vehicle speed has decreased by 3 kph in the last 5 years)
4. Remember – your policy solutions and direction of research will depend on the problem definition.
5. Avoid introducing a pre-defined policy solution in the problem statement. (Ex: Avg speed in Bangalore traffic is 10kph due to the small width of roads).
6. An ideal problem statement should be captured in one-two statements.
7. A good problem statement will also see iterations throughout the research period. The first iteration will rarely be the final one.
8. A problem definition can also be written as a goal to be achieved.


###  Step 2: Collecting Evidence
1. This is a time-consuming process.
2. Collecting evidence happens throughout the 8-steps.
3. The first motivation for collecting evidence is to ‘prove’ that your problem statement is in fact a problem.
4. Also important to show that your version of the problem statement is the ‘correct’ version.

###  Step 3: Constructing Alternatives
1. It is at this stage that you analyse the problem statement using all that you
have learnt during the course to get to the root cause(s) of the problem.
2. An alternative is simply a proposed solution to the policy problem
3. Your alternatives have to be mutually exclusive from each other. At this stage, build alternatives that, by itself, can solve a major portion of the problem
4. Ideally, your first alternative should be the status-quo. This will highlight either that the existing set of solutions can solve the problem by itself and additional intervention could hamper the process. Or it could also reveal the cost of doing nothing.
5. Your last alternative can be something dramatically opposite to status-quo.
6. Be wise and reduce your workload. Look around for existing policy solutions that someone else has figured out. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Then, look at the feasibility of the solution in your context.
7. Keep in mind your budgets and targets.

###  Step 4: Select the Criteria      
1. After the analytical process of constructing alternatives, you will have to delve into some subjective and evaluative processes.
2. Remember that the criteria constructed for alternatives are used for judging the OUTCOMES of the alternative and not the alternatives themselves.
3. One common criterion is Efficiency – the extent to which the sum total of individual utility is maximised.
4. This is where you would use a cost-benefit analysis.
5. Other criteria you could use: timeliness, state capacity, feasibility of implementation, Equality, Equity, Fairness, Legality.
6. At this stage, do not bring in political feasibility (this will/won’t win votes – a masterful politician can spin anything).
7. Also, a good practice to define the criteria in your context.

##### Examples 
1. Criterion 1. Efficiency – The number of jobs created per million rupees spent by the government. Alternatively, amount taken to create an additional job.
2. Criterion 2. Equity – Relative changes in income
3. Criterion 3. Timeliness – Time taken to bring down unemployment level from 12% to 5%
4. Criterion 4. Administrative capacity – Least amount of leakages and lowest transaction costs.


###  Step 5: Project the Outcomes
1. 1. Perhaps the most difficult stage in the entire process.
2. Be realistic in projecting the outcomes. Do not over-glorify your preferred solution as the answer to all of mankind’s problems. Be tentative.
3. Use the principles of policy analysis and economic reasoning to reasonably project the different outcomes.
4. Use different branches of studies to undertake this task – what is the psychological impact, what are the cultural factors that may determine the success, etc.
5. 5. Ascribe magnitudes – The burden of proof will fall on you. You need to say how much will a particular criterion change due to the proposed policy solution.
6. You will also need to make cost estimates, funding decisions (where will th money come from?), who will carry it out? Which department? Stakeholders
7. Estimate the probability of failure and the cost of that failure.
8. Be quite skeptical of your own solution. Look at how incentives play out throughout the system. How can you change those incentives?8. Unintended Consequences – Be very careful about the possible unintendedconsequences and undesired side-effects. These include moral hazard, overregulation leading to underground markets, rent-seeking, etc.
9. Put yourself in the place of the relevant stakeholders and ask how you wouldreact to the proposed alternative.
10. Construct an Outcomes matrix.

### Step 6. Confront the Tradeoff
1. It is possible that one of your alternatives outperforms the otheralternatives on every single one of your evaluation criteria in what is called dominance.
2. However, more likely, your various alternatives will outperform one another in different criteria forcing you to clarify the trade-offs between outcomes associated with different policy alternatives.
3. Not all criteria will be equally important. Some might be far more important than others. Give weightage to the criteria.
4. It is important to try to monetise the outcomes/ascribe magnitudes in orderto confront the trade-offs. Can put numbers on life/environment as well, though much harder.

### Step 7. Decide 
1. If you have done all the other steps correctly, this should be shortest step in the 8-steps. 
2. Ask yourself one question though: If my favourite policy alternative is such  great idea, why has it not been done already?
3. You would then come up with other difficulties that possibly exists in the way of the successful implementation of your policy.

### Step 8. Tell your story
1. Use the Reverse Bollywood Format. State the problem definition and the solution right up front.
2. The solutions statement should have the following aspects: In order to tackle “policy problem”, we have to do “preferred solution”, which will achieve X in Y time and will cost Z.
3. Your final output will not contain all the steps that you did in the 8-steps.
