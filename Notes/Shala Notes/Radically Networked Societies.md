#radicallynetworkedSocieties 

The structure of the modern nation-state was forged in the Industrial Age. It  now confronts the demands of the Information Age and is increasingly found  wanting. A [[Radically networked society]] is flat, its demands are diverse and often   inchoate, decision-making processes are amorphous, and leadership diffuse.  
However, such a society is governed by a government that operates in a  
hierarchical manner, top-down and bottom-up, in silos, bound by hard rules and   distinct leadership. While a networked society moves fast, a hierarchical  government moves relatively slowly on account of its structure. To members of   networked societies the hierarchical government appears slow, less responsive  and remote, hence lacking in credibility and legitimacy. One reason the United  States emerged on top of the world order is because it had the best political  system for post-Enlightenment industrial age societies. It may well be that the  nation that best reinvents itself for the information age will have a shot at being  the next great superpower. 

There’s no theory that won’t be questioned by radically connected
individuals, irrespective of the evidence backing it.
- all issues are by default global
- highly-specialised issues are vigorously contested by laypersons
- decisions by authoritative organisations are questioned, debated,
and sometimes overturned, in a vastly expanded information
sphere.


> The Overton Window on practically every issue has
been stretched such that nearly all possible positions on an issue
have become socially acceptable. With that happening, the older
institutions, which earlier exuded authority, are shredding
legitimacy with every decision they make.
