##  Shala Notes
**_SOCIAL REVOLUTION BY THE CONSTITUTION_**

The nature of government as an institution is such that it is better at certain tasks and worse in others. It does relatively better at collecting revenues and employing force. It does relatively worse at producing and distributing goods, and distributing funds. It does much worse in changing behaviours and therefore in changing society.

The case for limited government, as Milton Friedman, American economist and others make, is based on realisation that the government is not an effective agent to achieve many desirable social objectives.

**SOCIAL REVOLUTION & LEGITIMACY**

The Indian Republic, through both the Indian Constitution and popular imagination, sees the government as an agent of social change. In fact, the framers of India's Constitution noted that it (the Constitution) is India's way of achieving a social revolution. The Indian Constitution is different from other Constitutions in that it consciously codifies the rules of a society that all Indians must abide by. The framers of the Constitution put in provisions that, despite rank, caste or gender, placed every Indian on an equal footing and allowed the independent state to start afresh on certain foundational principles.

To the extent that the Constitution upholds values, laws, and ideas that are different from and opposed to social norms and traditions, there are two effects:

First, the government has to prevail over deep-rooted resistance and opposition in society. Note that governments generally are weaker in changing human behaviour. So, the Indian government is compelled to engage in tasks which are not its strengths.

Second, the contradiction between social norms and Constitutional norms work to delegitimise the state (and therefore the government) in the eyes of society. Disregard for laws is fungible, and a disregard for one set of laws creates an overall culture of lax respect for, adherence to and enforcement of laws. Note that the enforcers are themselves part of the same society (unlike colonial rulers).

The political process is expected to negotiate the contradictions. This poses additional limitations on any government in India.

**COMPETENCY V. EXPECTATION**

As subjects of an active government, we have some expectations. Provision of basic health facilities, clean water, primary education, maybe even a breathable environment – these are all expectations that people have from their governments. Often, these expectations are not fully met. Think of the most common problems people have with their governments – the system is slow, inefficient, forceful, even corrupt. These are problems of competency of the government.

Clearly, there is a mismatch between what a citizen expects from their government and what the government is poised to provide. Bridging this gap is a legitimate public policy endeavour.

**AMBITION V. COMPETENCE**

Governments are very good at doing some things, but not competent at some others. Collecting revenues versus producing and distributing goods, for instance. Governments are also far worse at changing behaviour of people in society. However, whether or not they are good at some things, it is often apparent that governments attempt these tasks in any case.

Our ambition from our government follows from the social revolution – we expect it to do grand things. Since the Constitution is the embodiment of this social revolution, a lot of our ambition arises from the Constitution. However, the reality is that there is a competence and ambition mismatch.

Can you think of any examples where this paradox is visible?

**WELFARE STATE = PERFECT ALIBI FOR THE SELFISH CITIZEN?**

The taxpaying citizen would obviously expect a commensurate return from her government. However, in a welfare state, the government is supposed to care equally for the taxpayer as well as for the person below the tax-base.

What if the taxpayer says that she has fulfilled her duties by paying the due taxes to the government and that she needn’t do more.

Since the government of a welfare state has undertaken the job of caring for everyone, is the taxpaying selfish citizen now justified in absolving herself of any further duties to the society?

**GOVERNANCE GAP** In growing economies, when the private sector (or migration to a foreign country) offers far better careers, prestige, and income than the public sector, the flow of talent to the government suffers. So the gap between the private sector (that attracts better, ambitious people) and the public sector widens. The governance gap is simultaneously a talent gap, a knowledge gap, a capability gap.

Note that financial constraints are not fundamental limitations of the Indian government. You will learn why this is so in the CP102 module. [Friedman Role of Government in Free Society](https://youtu.be/LucOUSpTB3Y).

**CONTESTED INFORMATION**

As you can see from the debate over poverty line figures, the number of illegal immigrants in India, UID/Aadhaar etc, while a lot of information is collected and analysed, it is invariably politically contested.

The contestation itself arises due to a number of reasons but it turns data from empirical fact to political football — undermining its usability for making public policy. In fact, the more important the data the more it is likely to be contested.

Reward-linked information-gathering further compounds the problem. For instance, poverty head counts conducted so as to distribute BPL cards (that entitle holders to subsidies) invariably cause more people to declare themselves poor.

**SCALING** In the case of India, problems are scaling faster than solutions. It's not uncommon for a new flyover to be jammed the day it opens. Why do you think this is the case?

**_PARADOXES AND PITFALLS_**

The circumstances under which accurate perception is most difficult are exactly the circumstances under which (policy) analysis is generally conducted-dealing with highly ambiguous situations on the basis of information that is processed incrementally under pressure for early judgment. This is a recipe for inaccurate perception.

There is a risk that we identify the problem inaccurately because of various pressures: for instance, there is scarcely a policy area where political, ideological, media, personal and time pressures do not affect the policy analyst and/or decision-maker.

Similarly, "memory" poses risks. What, why and how much one remembers are questions. Also, as shown masterfully in Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon", a Japanese movie, different persons can remember different things even when it is about the same objective event. Memory and perception are linked to "job experience".

Given what we know about the difficulties in perception and memory, what can we say about the value of experience? There is an inherent tension between experience as a "been there done that"/"it won't work", and experience as a "shoulders of giants".

**_FALLACIES_**

Fallacies: Causation vs Correlation. Just because the sun rises after the rooster crows, it doesn't mean that the sun rises because the rooster crows. This is called the Oldest Mistake in Public Policy (OMIPP). See why [Correlation does not imply causation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation)

Fallacies: Anecdotal vs Empirical. One common fallacy is to presume what you see/observe is the general problem. For instance, a person who observes that in a particular village, poverty is linked to exploitation by absentee landlords, might conclude that poverty in all villages is due to this cause. The person might then decide to pursue an anti-poverty policy across the whole country that targets absentee landlords. This can have dangerous and disastrous consequences if rural poverty elsewhere is due to other causes.

Fallacies: ideological blinders. Often the problem is defined (as are the solutions) before the problem is perceived. A 'villain' is assigned and all problems assigned to him. The policy then is about attacking the villain and being engaged in a war to defeat the villain. The actual problems are incidental to this.

Fallacies: bureaucratic blinders. "This is the way the department has always tackled the problem. This is the right way if only XYZ were taken care of." This leads us to fail to question why XYZ is the cause of policy failure? If XYZ can't be changed in reality, then does this approach make sense?

Fallacies: Hope & despair. The former causes one to repeat mistakes. The latter causes one not to try new approaches. Make sure you watch these talks by Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely. [Kahneman](http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory?language=en) [Ariely](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions?language=en)

## Reading Notes
      

**Ornit Saini on India’s first election:**

-   173 million people during partition
-   1935 - franchise was for 1/5th people - narrow and divided way
-   85% illiterate, 85% never voted
-   Women don’t realise themselves as individuals - first election - 2,5 million women can’t be included as they were registered as wife/widow
-   Who can vote

-   21, 180 dates
-   Problem was that people were refugges, and they were finally registered as well

-   Letters were sent to princely states to get advisors
-   Going to house to house 2 register
-   BM Rao - constitutional advisor
-   **_It was truly transformative- Electoral democracy_**
-   Paradoxically this also brought about group ideologies
-   **Indian became voters before they became citizens**

  

  

**Why is India a flailing state that both fail and succeed:**

-   ❛ Pritchett argued that there is a massive disconnect between its elite institutions and the frontline institutions. This has resulted in what is often called as ‘last mile delivery problem’. ❜. ❛ Inadequate local government resources: ❜ Resource constraints affect performance by forcing local of몭cials to multitask excessively and this inability to specialize has an adverse impact on the performance of development programmes.” ❜
-   because the administrative apparatus has not been able to provide basic services to a large section of its population. ❜
-   ❛ The Indian state has delivered better in certain situations and settings specifically on macroeconomic rather than microeconomic outcomes; where delivery is episodic with inbuilt exit, rather than where delivery and accountability are quotidian and more reliant on state capacity at local levels; and on those goods and services where societal norms and values concerning hierarchy and status matter less, rather than in settings where these norms (caste and patriarchy) are resilient.” ❜
-   ❛ Democracies **ought to tax more and spend more**. But India has never followed that path. ❜. Lack of fiscal balance
-   **Inadequate Local government Resources**
-   **Precocious democracy:** ❛ The fact that the Indian state started redistribution at an early stage of economic development when the state capacity was not high, explains why it fails to provide basic services to its citizens. ❜ —— **Redistributive Society**

-   ❛ This has led to ‘exit’ (in the sense of Hirschman 1970) of India’s middle class. Feeling that it has not received enough from the state by way of public goods, the Indian middle class exits in favor of private provisions and is also reluctant to pay taxes.” ❜
-   ❛ The political class in India tends to favor signaling syndrome. The “politicians will tend to emphasize the provision of goods that are visible and can be provided quickly, infrastructure, over long term investments like human capital.” ❜

-   **Workforce Consumption:**

-   **Working age population - 14+ = Billion+**
-   **Labor force = everyone looking for work =** **380 to 400 million? Where are these people going - some are in college and a lot are doing WHAT?**
-   **Workforce = that share of people who are working=** **people are leaving the workforce in India**

-   **BROADER QUESTION - what do we do for our labor force participation(also at the dismal women labor force participation)**

-   **The Persistence of Social Hierarchies and Cleavages**

-   **Club goods**
-   **State Failures reflects Societal Failures**

-   It is better at building schools and giving bicycles to improve girls’ enrollment than at improving educational outcomes because what happens within the classrooms is affected by caste and gender norms. India’s state is even less effective in improving worrisome sex ratios, declining female labor force participation or generalized societal violence against women all of which are rooted to varying Degrees in socal norms ❜
-   **Two Conventional but Unpersuasive Explanations**

-   Unpersuasive Explanation 1: Bloated Size of the Indian State
-   Unpersuasive Explanation 2: Patronage State
