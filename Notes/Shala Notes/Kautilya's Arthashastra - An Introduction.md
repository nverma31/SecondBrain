## Learning Outcomes

3.  Understand the theoretical underpinnings of the treatise.
4.  Explore the text’s relevance and be acquainted with its limitations.

## Shala Notes
1.  Kautilya’s Arthashastra is the first surviving text on statecraft which arguably codifies the wisdom of the ages. It is a theoretical treatise and not a descriptive work. It is comprehensive in content and ‘normative-instructional’ in style.
2.  The text is a manual useful for the king or the ruling class. It uniquely combines the production of wealth and protection of territory in the domain of statecraft.
3.  The four key sciences (i.e. Philosophy, Vedas, Economics and Political Science) are the bedrock of a successful administration which eventually helps achieve the three pursuits of active life – _artha_, _dharma_ and _kama_.
4.  The theoretical approach of the text and universalism of ideas potentially make Kautilya’s Arthashastra a ‘classic’. It is a formative, ideational legacy where the roots of India’s strategic thought could possibly lie. Former NSA, Shivshankar Menon endorses this - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jorov4MYvys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jorov4MYvys)
5.  Finally, the text has its limitations. It has a historical context and is reflective of the prevailing socio-political order. However, the text’s key concepts and central ideas transcend time and context.
