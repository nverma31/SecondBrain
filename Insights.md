1. Respect > Data. Build **trust** before you ask for data. And **explain** clearly why you need it.
2. Don't directly ask for large commitment. **What's the promise here for micromobility -..????** 
> Question: When do people download the app and why do they do it?

3. Framing and Anchoring
4. In Most cases people want to see the cars and then expect to be hit by a series of login and omboarding screens

### Progressive Disclosure
Users are less overwhelmed if they're exposed to complex features later.1

Your new users have a specific goal in mind when they discover your app (see jobs-to-be-done framework).2

Your role is to identify your new users' hopes and pains quickly, and align your experience with their needs‚Äînot the other way around.


### Framing & Anchoring

The way you present information affects how users interpret and decide.

The same facts presented in two different ways can lead to different outcomes or decisions from people.1

It's best to frame your experience around the core value of your product, or else you risk wasting users' brain cycles.

Similarly, anchoring the status quo as very time-consuming helps users see the value of your product or feature.2


### Personalization Expectations

Asking questions creates expectations.

If you give your users the impression that you'll customize an experience based on their inputs, not delivering on that expectation can quickly backfire.

Personalization is an excellent way to improve activation and retention.1

But personalization done wrong is worse than no personalization at all.

### Endowment Effect

Users value something more if they feel it's theirs, including digital experiences.1

In this case, knowing that my book summary was waiting for me in my "Library" made me stick around until the very end (as you'll soon see).

This principle‚Äîcombined with good personalization‚Äîcan encourage your users to complete your onboarding.

### Psych Framework

Every user interaction will either add or subtract Psych, depending on the effort required and the alignment with goals.

The sum of these interactions determines how likely your users are to take action.

For example, Blinkist wasted my psych with a series of optional questions that provided very little value in return.1

But, there are also ways to psych up your users. We show you a step-by-step framework with tons of examples in our product psychology course.

### The Impact Of Transparency

Blinkist ran an interesting trial paywall experiment on this screen. It led to:

-   23% more trial signups
-   55% fewer customer complaints
-   Higher trial retention (and revenues)

We analyzed the psychology behind that AB test in a separate case study.

Would you like to see it? (it's free)

### Immersive Experiences

Distraction-free interfaces can greatly increase your user engagement.

Whether that's for **surveys** (_Typeform_), **productivity apps** (_Notion_), and even **content**¬†(this case study immersed you enough to read until here üòâ).

For example, we saw a **280% increase** in user engagement for our case studies when we defaulted them to fullscreen.1

### Habits = Dominos

This nudge might seem trivial.

It's not.

It's **THE MOST important action** of TikTok's onboarding. You see, habit-forming products behave like dominos:

![dominos](https://media.slid.es/uploads/996460/images/7752412/main-domino.jpg)

The more you swipe, the more likely you are to **keep swiping**.1

But TikTok needs you to swipe _juuuuust_ once to start the **chain reaction**.

Their end-goal is to get you to **swipe** **without even thinking about it** (habit).

### IP Sniffing For Personalization

TikTok **detects and uses your IP address**¬†to personalize your content based on what people around you enjoy.

But even if this eliminates the need for an extra iOS "Location Services" permission request, it could feel **intrusive**.

Especially in the context of TikTok's poor reputation when it comes to **privacy**¬†and handling **user data**.1

### Sticky Content

Popular videos on TikTok (like this one) all have the same things in common:

1. **Simple** (very short and basic)  
2. **Unexpected** (curiosity gap)  
3. **Concrete** (e.g. relevant to COVID19)  
4. **Emotional** (fun/fear, music-driven)  
5. **Story** (e.g. woman looking for a mask)

Science shows that those are 5 of the key elements to make an idea stick.1

### Hawthorne Effect

Users tend to behave differently when they know they're being observed.1

For apps that rely on behavior-based personalization (like TikTok), that's a problem since people will eventually hesitate to explore‚Äîor worst‚Äîget stuck in a content rabbit hole.2

A simple **solution** might be an "**Incognito Mode**" (like in Youtube).

### Variable Rewards & Habits

TikTok videos are more addictive than other social platforms for three reasons1:

1.  **‚è≥ Short**: 16 seconds in average (9x shorter than Facebook's average). The feed hence adapts faster.
2.  üëâ **Snapped**: There's no "aim" needed, just flick your finger and the video will be immersive every time.
3.  **üí• Surprising**: You either learn, laugh or be weirded out, but you always get something personalized.

This mix of **very low cognitive task** and **high variability** makes TikTok a textbook example of "addiction-forming design".

### Providing Exit Points

Allow users to **disengage** from your product with a **sense of completion**.1

If not, people will associate your product to a never-ending list of tasks (or an addictive **slot machine** in this case).

Not only it might help your long-term user retention, but most importantly‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶it's **the Humane thing to do**.

### Be Specific In Your Copy

Another way to earn people's trust is **to be very specific with the words you use** on screen.¬†

In this case, why not list all the different notifications instead of keeping the user guessing?


### The Promised Land

**Users come to your app with a specific intent.** Always remind them why they should use your app during their first experience.

In this case, I wanted to wake up refreshed every day, and at this point, it's hard to see how I'll get to this benefit.

PS: _Headspace_ is really good at showing the promised land! Want to be notified when we release a case study on it?


### Less Links, Less Leaks.

Navigation links are useful, but because of [Hick's Law](https://growth.design/psychology#hicks-law), they can also be an excuse for your visitors to leave your onboarding path.

Removing your header navigation in critical pages (e.g. signup) may **increase your conversion rate by 28%**. 1

### Brand Coherence

Investing in the brand coherence between your **marketing website** and your **user onboarding flow** can make a big difference in the experience and perceived **quality of your product**.

### Deferred Account Creation

Waiting until after users have seen your product's value before asking them to confirm their email can increase your "Signup" to "First Key Action" rate by up to **100%**1.

Just make sure you keep an eye on your overall **Activation** & **Revenue** metrics.

The overall lift has to be worth it, not just the top stats of your signup flow.

### Persona-Based Onboarding

Prompting users to **self-segment** through **one simple question** (e.g. choosing their use case) and customizing their onboarding experience can **increase their chances of reaching their "aha moment"**.

Trello later reported a **+36% lift in activation** through a mix of personalization experiments.

Appcues reported that this improved their users‚Äô **activation time by 74%**.1

Just make sure you don't drown users in **endless options**¬†or questions.2


### Mental Model Migration

If your product is innovative, it likely introduces **new concepts**.

Getting new users to understand those concepts will require them to **migrate** from their **old mental models** (e.g. todo items, Excel) to your **new concepts** (e.g. Trello's "cards", "boards" and "lists").1

### Endowment Effect

You **value** something more once you feel like you **own it** in some way.

By making users **invest** a tiny bit of **customization effort**, they're more likely to feel like a new app is now "theirs". 1


### When Everybody Zigs, Zag.

To rise above the competition, brands need to **embrace the power of differentiation.**1

HEY is taking on big players like Google and Apple. They can't succeed by saying, "here's the best email service."

They can only succeed by **sharing their true story.**2


### Contextual Onboarding

Make sure you **show the right message to the right user at the right time.**

Rather than **asking your users to remember everything** up-front, you should provide guidance as they go.1


### Prioritize Your Aha! Moment

Making people **realize the value of your product** is critical for your onboarding.1

With good data and user research, you can pinpoint **your engaged users' common behaviors.**

Integrate them early in your onboarding to make future users stick.

- ### Priming

Priming consists of **subtle visuals** that influence how we respond.

The friendly-looking airport landscape lets the users dream about their next trip  **increasing the chances of a positive experience.**
### User-Driven Prompt

If you need information or private access **early in the product experience**, implement ways where **the user** **deliberately** **triggers the prompt.**

When actions are **driven by user intent**, the experience on the user's side feels more natural; hence, the **better conversion.**

Here's one way to solve this:
