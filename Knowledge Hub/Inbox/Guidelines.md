## Guidelines for Navigating the Interface
- Standardize task sequences. Allow users to perform tasks in the same sequence and manner across similar conditions.
- Ensure that links are descriptive. When using links, the link text should accurately describe the link’s destination.
- Use unique and descriptive headings. Use headings that are distinct from one another and conceptually related to the content they describe.
- Use radio buttons for mutually exclusive choices. Provide a radio button control when users need to choose one response from a list of mutually exclusive options.
- Develop pages that will print properly. If users are likely to print one or more pages, develop pages with widths that print properly.
- Use thumbnail images to preview larger images. When viewing full-size images is not critical, ﬁrst provide a thumbnail of the image.

## Guidelines for Organising the Interface
1. Consistency of data display. During the design process, the terminology, abbreviations, formats, colors, capitalization, and so on should all be standardized and controlled by use of a dictionary of these items.
2. Eﬃcient information assimilation by the user. The format should be familiar to the operator and should be related to the tasks required to be performed with the data. This objective is served by rules for neat columns of data, left justiﬁcation for alphanumeric data, right justiﬁcation of integers, lining up of decimal points, proper spacing, use of comprehensible labels, and appropriate measurement units and numbers of decimal digits.
3. Minimal memory load on the user. Users should not be required to remember information from one screen for use on another screen. Tasks should be arranged such that completion occurs with few actions, minimizing the chance of forgetting to perform a step. Labels and common formats should be provided for novice or intermittent users.
4. Compatibility of data display with data entry. The format of displayed information should be linked clearly to the format of the data entry. Where possible and appropriate, the output ﬁelds should also act as editable input ﬁelds.
5. Flexibility for user control of data display. Users should be able to get the information from the display in the form most convenient for the task on which they are working. For example, the order of columns and sorting of rows should be easily changeable by the users. 

## Guidelines for Getting user's Attention
1. Intensity. Use two levels only, with limited use of high intensity to draw attention.
2. Marking. Underline the item, enclose it in a box, point to it with an arrow, or use an indicator such as an asterisk, bullet, dash, plus sign, or X.
3. Size. Use up to four sizes, with larger sizes attracting more attention.
4. Choice of fonts. Use up to three fonts.
5. Blinking. Use blinking displays (2–4 Hz) or blinking color changes with great care and in limited areas, as it is distracting and can trigger seizures.
6. Color. Use up to four standard colors, with additional colors reserved for occasional use.
7. Audio. Use soft tones for regular positive feedback and harsh sounds for rare emergency conditions.

## Facilitating Data Entry
1. Consistency of data-entry transactions. Similar sequences of actions speed learning.
2. Minimal input actions by user. Fewer input actions mean greater operator productivity and—usually—fewer chances for error. Making a choice by a single mouse selection or ﬁnger press, is preferred over typing in a lengthy string of characters. Selecting from a list of choices eliminates the need for memorization, structures the decision-making task, and eliminates the possibility of typographic errors. A second aspect of this guideline is that redundant data entry should be avoided. It is annoying for users to enter the same information in two locations, such as entering the billing and shipping addresses when they are the same. Duplicate entry is perceived as a waste of eﬀort and an opportunity for error.
3. Minimal memory load on users. When doing data entry, users should not be required to remember lengthy lists of codes.
4. Compatibility of data entry with data display. The format of dataentry information should be linked closely to the format of displayed information, such as dashes in telephone numbers.
5. Flexibility for user control of data entry. Experienced users prefer to enter information in a sequence that they can control, such as selecting the color ﬁrst or size ﬁrst, when clothes s
