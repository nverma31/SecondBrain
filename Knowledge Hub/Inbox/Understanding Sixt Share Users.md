## Explorative Research - What's up with...
1. **Who are our users? What are their goals, attritudes, behaviours?**
2. **Why do people use car sharing?**
3. **Why do people use micro-mobility?**

## Desriptive and Explanatory Research - What and how?
1. **Who are our users? What are their goals, attritudes, behaviours?**


## Evaluative Research - Are we getting close?
1. Testing hypothesis and solutions that I'm proposing.

## Causal Research - Why is this happening?

1. How are our current solutions working?

## Hypothesis
1. The **Problem** we are trying to solve is the *"LAST-MILE"* via the micro-mobiity aspect, and 


## Assorted Questions
1. Why exactly are they interested in micro-mobility?
1. What is their current experience?
1. What to build and how it should behave?
1. What makes people buy?
1. What makes people loyal?
1. What message will be appleaing to them?

## Plan
*Identifying the Number and Type of Interviewees

Your interview plan is a persona hypothesis of sorts, since you need to figure out what kinds of people you think will have different needs, goals, and ways of thinking. The planning process generally looks something like this:
— Identify likely user roles. - **A role is defined by user tasks**
— Start with a minimum number based on how narrow the roles are.
— Multiply for the factors most likely to affect behavior.
— Look for ways to condense your scheduleand incorporate other factors.
— Adjust for possible no-shows and poor interviews.
