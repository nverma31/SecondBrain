# Design Patterns

> A pattern approach to interaction design would suggest **reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems** in user-interface and interaction design.
Patterns are essential in design because they are the building blocks of a designer’s vocabulary, as principles are the rules of grammar that govern how we use them. Seasoned designers can often work faster and come up with a wider range of ideas because they’ve had years in which to build up their vocabularies.
