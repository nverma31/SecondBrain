# Stakeholder Interviews

## Summary
1. Starting with a Kick-off meeting to get acquainted with basic goals and timeline.

### Example of an invitation to stakeholders

> As you may know, my colleagues and I are responsible for the product’s design. We understand that you are ultimately responsible for marketing Product X. We’d like to schedule a one-hour meeting with you next week to discuss the project. We’ll ask questions about your vision, goals, and concerns, as well as the role you expect to play in the project. We’d like to take advantage of your expertise, too, so we’ll have plenty of questions about XCorp and the industry. We would also appreciate it if you could share any useful documents, such as MRDs, white papers, or competitive product information.

## Things to watch out for
1. **Presumed constraints**—ask why they are constraints
2. **Jumping to solutions**—ask what problem the solution would solve
3. Identify the full range of stakeholders and meet with each — Take advantage of the expertise that’s available. [[#^3090d8]]
4.  Learn about hopes, fears, beliefs, and goals — Avoid taking assumptions at face value
5.  Remember that you’re not just asking questions—you’re also building essential relationships
