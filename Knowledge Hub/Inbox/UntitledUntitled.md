letterforms that honor and elucidate what humans see and say
deserve to be honored in their turn.

```
```
typography is just that: idealized writing.
19
```
```
literary style, says walter benjamin, "is the power to move freely in
the length and breadth of linguistic thinking without slipping into
banality: ' typographic style, in this large and intelligent sense of the
word, does not mean any particular style - my style or your style, or
neoclassical or baroque style - but the power to move freely through
the whole domain of typography, and to function at every step in a way
that is graceful and vital instead of banal...
19
```
```
the typographer's one essential task is to interpret and commu- nicate
the text. Its tone, its tempo, its logical structure, its physical size, all
determine the possibilities of its typographic form. The typographer is
to the text as the theatrical director to the script, or the musician to the
score.
20
```
```
the typographic performance must reveal, not replace, the inner
composition. Typographers, like other artists and craftsmen -
musicians, composers and authors as well - must as a rule do their work

and disappear.
21

```
the typographic page is a map of the mind; it is frequently also a map
of the social order from which it comes. And for better or for worse,
minds and social orders change.
```
22

```
this is the beginning, middle and end of the practice of typog- raphy:
choose and use the type with sensitivity and intelligence.
```
22

letterforms have tone, timbre, character, just as words and sentences
do. The moment a text and a typeface are chosen, two streams of
thought, two rhythmical systems, two sets of habits, or if you like, two
personalities, intersect. They need not live together contentedly forever,
but they must not as a rule collide.
22

another ancient metaphor: the density of texture in a written or typeset
page is called its _color. _

25

and color depends on four things: the design of the type, the spacing
between the letters, the spacing between the words, and the spacing
between the lines. None is independent of the others.
25

```
for a normal text face in a normal text size, a typical value for the
word space is a quarter of an em, which can be written m/4.
```
26

```
if the text is justified, a reasonable minimum word space is a fifth of
an em (m/5), and m/4 is a good average to aim for.
```

26

a reasonable maximum in justified text is m/2.
26

```
the 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces) is widely
regarded as ideal.
```
26

in titles and headings, extra letterspacing is often desirable.

30

but the extra space between letters will also require more space
between lines.
30

```
but when we come to the other extreme, the faces with no calligraphic
flow, letterspacing oflowercase letters can sometimes be of genuine
benefit.
```
32

where letters function one by one (as in acronyms, web-site and e-mail
addresses) letterspacing is likely to help, no matter whether the letters
are caps, small caps or lower case.

32

the simplest methods of emphasis available are underlining and
letterspacing.
32

kerning - altering the space between selected pairs of letters...
32

numbers are often omitted from kerning tables, but numbers often
need more kerning than letters do. Most fonts, both metal and digital,
are equipped with _tabular figures_ ...

33

## 2 rhythm & proportion - 2.2 vertical motion

## 2 rhythm & proportion - 2.3 blocks & paragraphs

```
space in typography is like time in music. It is infinitely divis- ible,
but a few proportional intervals can be much more useful than a
limitless choice of arbitrary quantities.
```
36

you choose and prepare a font, and you choose a measure (the width of
the column).

36

```
longer measures need more lead than short ones. Dark faces need
more lead than light ones. Large-bodied faces need more lead
than smaller-bodied ones. Faces like bauer bodoni, with
substantial color and a rigid vertical axis, need much more
lead than faces like bembo, whose color is light and whose
axis is based on the writing hand. And unserifed faces
often...
```
37

```
a text in german would ide- ally have a little more lead than the
same text in latin or french, purely because of the increased
frequency of capitals.
```
37

```
if you want more than 500 words to the page, it is time to consider
multiple columns. A two-column book page will comfortably carry 750
words. If it must, it can carry a thousand.

## small caps

```
all you may see on the keyboard is a space bar, but typographers use
several invisible characters: the word space, fixed spaces of various
sizes (em space, en space, thin space, figure space, etc) and a hard
space or no-break space. The hard space will stretch, like a normal
word space, when the line is justified, but it will not convert to a
linebreak. Hard spaces are useful for preventing linebreaks within
phrases such as 6.2 mm, 3 in. , 4 x 4, or in phrases like page 3 and
chapter...
```
43

```
it is true that text figures are rarely useful in classified ads, but they
are useful for setting almost everything else, including good magazine
and newspaper copy. They are basic parts of ty- pographic speech, and
they are a sign of civilization: a sign that dollars are not really twice as
important as ideas, and numbers are not afraid to consort on an equal
footing with words...
```
47

```
genuine small caps are not simply shrunken versions of the full caps.
They differ from large caps in stroke weight, letterfit, and internal
proportions as well as in height.
```
48

```
when a writer accepts them fully into her speech and urges readers to
do likewise, it is time for the typographer to ac- cept them into the
common speech of typography by setting them in lower case: unesco,
ascii (or ascii) and fortran. Other acronymic words, such as laser and
radar, have long since trav- eled the same road.

... S, quotation marks or parentheses, if these are in its way. Most of
the early european fonts were designed primarily for setting latin, in
which the sequences fb, fh, fj, fk do not oc- cur, but the sequences ff,
fi, fl, ffi, ff! Are frequent. The same set of ligatures was once
sufficient for english, and these five ligatures are standard in traditional
roman and italic fonts. As the craft of typography spread through
europe, new regional ligatures were added. An fj and re were needed
in norway and denmark for words such as fjeld and fjord and
mer...

50

```
if your software is inserting ligatures automatically, takea moment
to verify two things: (1) that the software is inserting all the
ligatures you want and none that you do not want; (2) that all these
ligatures are staying where they're put.

where such a feast of ligatures is present, they are usually divided into
classes: basic and discretion- ary.

and the series works the way it does not so much from force of custom
as from the force of physiology. The monumentality of the capitals, the

perpendicular, roman ground. Reverse the order and the text not only

bold and semibold faces do have their value. They can be used, for
instance, to flag items in a list, to set titles and subheads u&lc in small
sizes, to mark the opening of the text on a complex page, or to thicken
the texture of lines that will be printed...

simplicity is good, but so is plurality. Typography's principal func- tion
(not its only function) is communication, and the greatest threat to
communication is not difference but sameness. Com- munication
ceases when one being is no different from another: when there is
nothing strange to wonder at and no new infor- mation to exchange. For
that reason among others, typography and typographers must honor the
variety and complexity of hu- man language, thought and identity,
instead of homogenizing or hiding it...
```
89

```
the letterpress adds a little bulk and definition to the letter, especially
in the thin strokes, and increases the prominence of the ends of thin
serifs. Metal typefaces are designed to take advantage of these features
of letterpress printing. On the offset press - and in the photographic
procedures by which camera-ready art and offset printing plates are
prepared _ thin strokes tend to get thinner and the ends of delicate serifs
are eaten away.

consistency is one of the forms of beauty. Contrast is another.

120

out of this rich multiplicity of letters, a basic dichotomy evolved:
majuscules and minuscules _: _ large formal letters and smaller, more
casual ones: the upper and lower case, as we call them now.

120

in the later middle ages and the early renaissance, a well- trained
european scribe might know eight or ten distinct styles of script. Each
was defined as precisely as a typeface, stored like a font in the human
memory, and each had certain uses.
121

but letterforms are not only objects of science. They also belong to the
realm of art, and they participate in its history. They have changed over
time just as music, painting and architecture have changed, and the
same historical terms - renaissance, ba- roque, neoclassical,
romantic, and so on - are useful in each of these fields. This
approach to the classification ofletterforms has another important
advantage. Typography never occurs in isolation. Good typography
demands not only a knowledge of type itself, but an understanding of
the relationship between letterforms and the
121

```
other things that humans make and do. Typographic history is just that:
the study of the relationships between type designs and the rest of
human activity - politics, philosophy, the arts, and the history of ideas.
It is a lifelong pursuit, but one that is informative and rewarding from
the beginning...

baroque typography, like baroque painting and music, is rich with
activity and takes delight in the restless and dramatic play of
contradictory forms.

baroque italics are ambidextrous: both right- and lefthanded. And it
was during the baroque that typographers first made a habit of mixing
roman and italic on the same line.
```
127

```
generally speaking, neoclassical art is more static and restrained than
either renaissance or baroque art, and far more interested in rigorous
consistency.
```
128

128

in neoclassical letters, an echo of the broadnib pen can still be seen,
but it is rotated away from the natural writing angle to a strictly
vertical or rationalist axis.
128

```
they are products of the rational- ist era: frequently beautiful, calm
forms, but forms oblivious to the more complex beauty of organic fact.
If baroque letterforms are ambidextrous, neoclassical letters are, in
their quiet way, neitherhanded.

129

both neoclassical and romantic letterforms adhere to a
rationalist axis, and both look more drawn than written, but
it is possible to make some precise distinctions between the
two.
130

```
this remarkable shift in type design - like all structural
shifts in type design - is the record of an underlying change
in handwrit- ing. Romantic letters are forms from which the
broadnib pen has vanished. In its place is the pointed and
flexible quill. The broadnib pen produces a smoothly modulated
stroke whose thickness varies with direction, but the pointed
quill performs quite differently. The stroke of a flexible quill
shifts suddenly from thin to thick to thin again, in
response to changes in pressure. Used with restraint, it
pro- duces a neoclassical flourish. Used with greater force,
it produces a more dramatic and romantic one. Dramatic
contrast, which is essential to much romantic music and
painting, is essential to romantic type design as well...
```
130

```
romantic letters can be extraordinarily beautiful, but they lack
the flowing and steady rhythm of renaissance forms. It is
that rhythm which invites the reader to enter the text and
read. The statuesque forms of romantic letters invite the
reader to stand outside and look at the letters instead.

Realist letters very often have the same basic shape as neoclassical and
romantic letters, but most of them have heavy, slab serifs or no serifs
at all. The stroke is often uniform in weight, and the aperture (often a
gauge of grace or good fortune in typefaces) is tiny. Small caps, text
figures and other signs of sophistication and elegance are almost
always missing...

designers of type during those years were equally busy rediscovering
the pleasures of writing letterforms rather than drawing them. In
rediscovering calligraphy, they redis- covered the broadnib pen, the

modernism is fundamentally the reassertion of renaissance form. There
is no hard line between modernist design and renaissance revival...

postmodern letterforms, like postmodern buildings, fre- quently
recycle and revise neoclassical, romantic and other premodern forms.
At their best, they do so with an engaging lightness of touch and a fine
sense of humor. Postmodern art is for the most part highly self-
conscious, but devoutly unserious. Postmodern designers - who
frequently are or have been mod- ernist designers as well - have proven
that it is possible to infuse neoclassical and romantic form, and the
rationalist axis, with genuine calligraphic energy.

136

in that respect at least, postmodernism and modernism alike confront
the basic task with which typography began. That is the task of
answering in two (or little more than two) dimensions to a world that
has many.

```
sizing and spacing type, like composing and performing music or
applying paint to canvas, is largely concerned with intervals and
differences.
```
145

```
the perfect intervals (fifth and fourth) coincide exactly with the
favorite page shapes of the european middle ages, which are
still in use today: the page proportions 2: 3 and 3: 4.

147

some proportions also seem particularly linked to living things. [t
is true that wastage is often increased when an 8\12 x 11 inch
page is trimmed to i~4 x 11 or 6 % x 11, or when a 6 x 9
book page is nar - rowed to 5% x 9. But an organic page looks
and feels different from a mechanical page, and the shape of the
page itself will provoke certain responses and expectations in the
reader, independently of whatever text it contains.

for all the beauty of pure geometry, a perfectly square block of type on
a perfectly square page with even margins all around is a form unlikely
to encourage reading. Reading, like walking, involves navigation - and
the square block of type on a square block of paper is short of basic
landmarks and clues. To give the reader a sense of direction, and the
page a sense of liveliness and poise, it is necessary to break this
inexorable sameness and find a new balance of another kind. Some
space must be narrow so that other space may be wide, and some space
emptied so that other space may be filled...
```
163

```
in typography, margins must do three things. They must lock the
textblock to the page and lock the facing pages to each other through
the force of their proportions. Second, they must frame the text- block
in a manner that suits its design. Third, they must protect the
textblock, leaving it easy for the reader to see and convenient to
handle. (that is, they must leave room for the reader's thumbs...

in fact, the weaving of the text and the tailoring of the page are
thoroughly interdependent. We can discuss them one by one, and we
can separate each in turn into a series of simple, unintimidat- ing
questions. But the answers to these questions must all, in the end, fold
back into a single answer. The page, the pamphlet or the book must be
