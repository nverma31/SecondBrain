## Netbike Open issues
-  **Racks:**:  
	- Did we implement the whole rack functionality backend wise?
	- Are there cities, which only offer racks and no free floating bikes (e.g. Mannheim), which we want to offer as well?
	- Do the racks work the same way for fork locks and frame locks or does it differ?

````
➡️ If we can figure out, whether the bike is taken from a rack, we can talk about how to open it and that is a separate discussion.

➡️ Do we just have a fork lock and frame lock bike, or a combination lock bike as well?
➡️ Moreover, we have to indicate how parking works, I don't think we are following the difference.
````
- **Pausing fork lock** à How does the pausing of a fork lock work in detail, what do you need to do in which order in the app & bike computer?
- **Auto cancel frame lock** - 3 minutes –à Do we have the auto cancel functionality for the frame locks after 3 minutes?
- **Differences MVG bikes and other fork lock bikes**?! à Do we have differences in the App flows and pin codes between normal bikes (4 digit & P) & MVG bikes (6 digits & X)?


**The main question is whether we can identify the kind of bike and then show the instructions accordingly.**
