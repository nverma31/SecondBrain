# Deep Work

## Summary
1. **Multitasking and distractions are enemies of the productivity**
2. **There are different strategies for achieving deep work – all of which require intention.**
	1. The first is the _monastic_ approach. This strategy works by eliminating all sources of distraction and secluding yourself like a monk.✅🧘‍♂️
	2. The second is called the _bimodal_ approach, which involves setting a clearly defined, long period of seclusion for work and leaving the rest of your time free for everything else.✅⏰
	3. The third is the _rhythmic_ approach. The idea here is to form a habit of doing deep work for blocks of, say, 90 minutes and using a calendar to track your accomplishments.✅🎶
	4. And finally, the _journalistic_ strategy is to take any unexpected free time in your daily routine to do deep work. But regardless of which technique you employ, it’s key to remember that they’re methodical, not random. 
2. **Deep work is intentional and desired, which makes it essential to have rituals that prepare your mind for it.** For example - a space, food, boundaries.
3. **Focus your brain and be selective about your use of technology.**
4. **Scheduling both work and free time is essential to restoring energy.**
	> By scheduling everything you do, you’ll free up time for being mindful of how you spend it. Give your mind the space it needs to shut down.
