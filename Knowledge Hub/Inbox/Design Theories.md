Multiple theory types that researchers and designers consider when evaluating user interfaces.
> The central problem for human-computer–interaction researchers is developing adequate micro-HCI and macro-HCI theories. Traditional psychological theories must be extended and reﬁned to accommodate the complex human learning, memory, and problem solving required in user interfaces and user experiences. Useful goals include descriptive taxonomies, explanatory theories, and predictive models. When predictions can be made for learning times, performance speeds, error rates, subjective satisfaction, or human retention over time, designers can more easily choose among competing designs

## By Theory Type

1. Descriptive Describes user interfaces and their uses with consistent terminology and taxonomies
2. Explanatory Describes sequences of events with causal relationships
3. Prescriptive Oﬀers guidelines for designers to make decisions Predictive Enables comparison of design alternatives based on numeric predictions of speed or errors.

## By Human Capacity

1. Motor Skill in pointing, clicking, dragging, or other movements 
2. Perceptual Visual, auditory, tactile, and other human sensory inputs 
3. Cognitive Problem solving with short- and long-term memory


**Taxonomies** can be an important part of descriptive and explanatory theories. A taxonomy imposes order by classifying a complex set of phenomena into understandable categories. For example, a taxonomy might be created for diﬀerent kinds of input devices: direct versus indirect, linear versus rotary, 1-, 2-, 3- or higher-dimensional, and so on..

## Descriptive and Explanatory Theories
## Micro Theories
> The design-by-levels, stages-of-action, and consistency theories address the speciﬁcs of how objects and actions appear on displays and what actions users take to carry out their tasks. These theories and design aspects might be called micro-HCI, since they cover measurable performance in terms of speed and errors. MicroHCI is best studied with the scientiﬁc methods of experimental and cognitive psychology using 30- to 120-minute controlled experiments and statistical tests for signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups working on well-deﬁned tasks


### Design by level Theories
1. The **conceptual level** is the user’s “mental model” of the interactive system
2. The **semantic level** describes the meanings conveyed by the user’s input and by the computer’s output display.
3. The **syntactic level** deﬁnes how the user actions that convey semantics are assembled into complete sentences to perform certain tasks.
4. The **lexical level** deals with device dependencies and with the precise mechanisms by which users specify the syntax

> **Example**: Increasingly, actions are shown by novel visual representations (for example, a trash can for deletion or a play button to start playing a video). Users have to learn the semantics (e.g., that they can recover a ﬁle by opening up the trash can or stop a video by clicking on the pause button), but if the designers choose familiar objects to associate with the actions, users can quickly acquire the correct mental model for operating the user interface. Of course, users also have to learn the syntax of dragging objects or clicking to initiate the actions, but these mechanisms are commonly used and have become well known.


### Stages of Action Theories
Norman (2013) oﬀers seven stages of action, arranged in a cyclic pattern, as an explanatory theory of humancomputer interaction:

1. Forming the goal
2. Forming the intention
3. Specifying the action
4. Executing the action
5. Perceiving the system state
6. Interpreting the system state
7. Evaluating the outcome

> Furthermore, the seven stages of action lead naturally to identiﬁcation of the [[gulf of execution]] (the mismatch between the user’s intentions and the allowable actions) and the[[ gulf of evaluation ]](the mismatch between the system’s representation and the user’s expectations).

This theory leads Norman to suggest four [[Design Principles]] of good design: 
1. The state and the action alternatives should be visible.
2. There should be a good conceptual model with a consistent system image.
3. The interface should include good mappings that reveal the relationships between stages.
4. Users should receive continuous feedback.


> `ris:CheckboxCircle` Designers can apply the stages-of-action theory by thinking deeply about the beginning, middle, and end stages to ensure that they cover a wide enough scope of usage. Many new products emerge as a result of adding novel features to what was considered a welldeﬁned process; for example, expanding the music-playing process to include the earlier stages of music purchase or composition and the later stages of music sharing or reviewing/rating


### Consistency Theories

> Consistency for objects and actions (nouns and verbs) is a good starting point, but there are many other forms of consistency that require careful thought by designers. Consistent use of color, layout, icons, fonts, font sizes, button sizes, and much more is vital in giving users a clear understanding of the interface. Inconsistency in elements such as the positioning of buttons or colors will slow users down by 5–10%, while changes to terminology slow users by 2025%.
   Consistency is an important goal, but there may be conﬂicting forms of consistency, and sometimes inconsistency is a virtue (for example, to draw attention to a dangerous action.


## Macro Theories

 ### Contextual Theories
 
 > The outcomes of micro-HCI research are statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences that support or refute a hypothesis, while the outcomes of macro-HCI research are insights about what leads to increased user satisfaction, how the context of use matters, and how new applications could improve education, health, safety, or the environment.

 -  Contextual theories are especially relevant to mobile devices and ubiquitous computing innovations
 -  Designers can apply contextual theories by observing users in their own environments as they carry out their work, engage socially, or participate in sports or play.
 -  While contextual theories emphasize the changes to observation and research, contextual theories can also guide design. If interruptions are an impediment, then users might be given the option of blocking them.

**A taxonomy of mobile device applications could guide innovators:**
1. Monitor blood pressure, stock prices, or air quality and give alerts when normal ranges are exceeded.
2. Gather information from meeting attendees or rescue team members and spread the action list or current status to all. 
3. Participate in a large group activity by voting and relate to speciﬁc individuals by sending private messages.
4. Locate the nearest restaurant or waterfall and identify the details of the current location.
5. Capture information or photos left by others and share yours with future visitors.

 ### Dynamic Theories
 
   > A key aspect of macro-HCI is how users evolve over weeks and months, especially as they move from novices to experts, from new customers to frequent buyers, or from readers of Wikipedia to active collaborators or administrators.

   > Macro-HCI theories also promote the idea that user interfaces have profound societal eﬀects with positive outcomes such as increased social communication, safety, or health awareness and negative outcomes such as undermining concentration, invading privacy, or exposing users to hackers. Visionaries see user interfaces as shaping personal processes of mindfulness, reﬂection, or empathy and community processes of civic participation, democratic sharing, or conﬂict resolution

   > Dynamic theories are strong among designers of online communities and user-generated content sites. They know that users often move through stages as they gain conﬁdence and a greater sense of responsibility for quality. There are many paths, but a study of Wikipedia contributors (Bryant et al., 2005) suggests at least these stages: (1) reader of articles related to personal interests, (2) ﬁxer of mistakes and omissions in familiar topics, (3) registered user and caretaker for a collection of articles, (4) author for new articles, (5) participant in community of authors, and (6) administrator who is active in governance and future directions.
