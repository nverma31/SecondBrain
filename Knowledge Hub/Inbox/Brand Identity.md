# Brand Identity

Your brand identity covers everything from your logo, to typography, colour, tone of voice, photography, illustration, creative direction, motion, and so on. It answers questions such as:

	• What is our logo, and how do we use it?
	• What fonts and colours do we use — why, when, and how do we use them?
	• Do we have any cross-platform considerations (web, iOS, Android)?
	• Art and creative direction: what style of imagery do we use?
	• How do we use photography, illustration, icons, animation, and video?
	• Do we have any guiding principles for motion?
