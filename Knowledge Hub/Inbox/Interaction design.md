# Interaction Design

Interaction design is a discipline focused on defining the form and behavior of interactive products, services, and systems. Interaction design answers questions such as:

- — What activities does the product or service support, and how?

- — What workflow provides the best way for users to accomplish their goals?

- — What information do users need at each point in that process?

- — What information does the system need from users?

- — How will users move from one activity to another?

- — How is functionality segmented and manifested?

Because interaction design is focused on what people want to do as well as how they can best accomplish it, it’s common for interaction design to affect product definition, which is about what functionality a product has (as opposed to defining how that functionality is manifest, which is what most people see as the role of design).

Interaction design is often confused with related disciplines known as HCI, human factors or, informally, usability. Training in these fields emphasizes evaluative techniques rather than creative problem-solving skills or methods for generating solutions, which are the focus in design. The line between these professions and interaction design is fuzzy because many people have found their way to interaction design from these fields. Although interaction designers must be versed in the principles of HCI, most interaction designers find more in common with graphic designers and industrial designers than with evaluation-focused HCI professionals. The two approaches result in a difference in worldview much like the one between software engineering and quality assurance: complementary, but not at all interchangeable.
