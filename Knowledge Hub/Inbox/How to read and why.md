# How to read and why
## Why read
1. In order to strengthen the self and to learn its authentic Interests.
2. Not to improve society, rather self-improvement is a large enough project.
3. Creative reading; Self-trust is nor an endowment, but is the Second Birth of the mind, which cannot come without years of deep reading
4. the recovery ofthe ironic; Understanding and learning to live with dichotomy of thought and existence.
5. that we cannot know enough people profoundly enough; that we need to know ourselves better; that we require knowledge, not just of self and others, but of the way things are.
6. There is a reader's Sublime, and it seems the only secular transcendence we can ever attain, except for the even more precarious transcendence we call " falling in love."
