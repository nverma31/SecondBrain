# Interaction Designers

#### shared skills adn responsibilities
1. interaction designer (IxD) must be good at understanding complex domains and systems and reducing them to clear models and concepts.
2. It’s important for interaction designers to be well versed in the human factors and cognitive psychology principles that apply to a given problem.
3. should practice presentations within the design team before delivering them to stakeholders.
4. Collaboration also takes practice. Co-ideation can be a smooth and effective process or a slow and painful one. Most designers go through a phase in which their confidence outpaces their skill, making it difficult for them to see flaws in their thinking. Many eventually recognize they’re not infallible.
5. Early in their careers, IxD generators usually need help developing their narrative sense, while IxD synthesizers tend to need help with their structural thinking.


## 2 flavours
1. **Synthesizer**

	 **Clear, good communication, detail-oriented**
	 
> With their narrative point of view, design communicators were able to identify problems not evident from looking at a design solely in the structural sense. They also helped ensure that the design was complete, partly by using documentation as a design aid: When you have to explain the design thoroughly enough for an engineer to build it, you’ll naturally ask questions about how it works, what happens when this or that button is pressed, and why a particular solution is good.
> Every great synthesizer has a certain discomfort with ambiguity, an ability to identify a fuzzy idea and not let go of it until it becomes clear.
> Communicating about design—which remains a key aspect of the role—requires the ability to organize and prioritize ideas into a coherent, concise, and persuasive narrative that’s appropriate to the audience. This includes identifying the key points of what must be communicated, figuring out the best communication medium (whether a photo, a diagram, or a page of prose), and implementing it in a clear, concise manner. IxD synthesizers must be detail-oriented enough to explain everything an engineer needs to build a custom widget, but must also be good at explaining the big picture and the reasons the widget needs to work that way. This quality usually makes synthesizers good at project management, too.

2. **Generator**
	
	**Ability and drive to visualize concrete solutions.** 
 > A generator’s most critical skill is the one that defines all of the traditional design disciplines: the ability and drive to visualize concrete solutions. If someone isn’t facile at generating and sketching ideas with a whiteboard marker in her hand, she’s not right for the role. Any team that doesn’t include this generative skill will usually struggle to make progress at any speed.
 > Visualization skill is usually accompanied by a certain amount of confidence; it takes faith in one’s own judgment to put rough ideas out in public view for criticism. Although a good generator values user feedback and usability test results, she doesn’t hesitate to make decisions without them. Good designers in any discipline “know” they’re right, though this confidence can be an Achilles heel if it’s not accompanied by a willingness to hear why they might be wrong
 > The IxD generator is responsible for articulating the design in visual terms, initially in the form of sketches and eventually in the form of detailed screen shots;
