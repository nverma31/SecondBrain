- Figure this shit out. Research Here:

> you must have read about this in article 13 of the Indian constitution i guess so the laws made by government for the regulation of local authorities. The rules and regulations enacted by an association or a corporation to provide a framework for its operation laws may specify the qualifications, rights, and liabilities of membership, and the powers, duties, and grounds for the dissolution of an organization , the written rules for conduct of a corporation, association, partnership or any organization. They should not be confused with the Articles of Corporation which only state the basic outline of the company, including stock structure. Bylaws generally provide for meetings, elections of a board of directors and officers, filling vacancies, notices, types and duties of officers,committees, assessments and other routine conduct. Bylaws are, in effect a contract among members, and must be formally adopted and/or amended.#

When an Act Is passed by the Legisllature /Parliament. it provides for framing of rules by a particular authority in order to further the provisions of an Act, the rules made by such authority under delegated powers are called bylaw

By-laws are generally what a institution or a community defines for its governance and these are the rules to be followed by it’s members. Our constitution has vested that power in Parliament/legislature, so it may be construed that laws of the country are by-laws akin to that of an institution or company. Just a comparative context, I am not 100% sure though as I have never heard the reference of by-laws “in the Constitution” before..![[Screenshot 2021-12-20 at 13.22.31.png]]

 [Mygate](https://help.mygate.in/articles/16853-how-does-mygate-help-in-better-domestic-help-management) allows residents of an apartment complex to rate and review their domestic help, and can even prevent their access to the building once they are fired. However, the ratings are not two ways and the domestic help cannot rate the employer nor do they have a chance to question the actions and decisions taken about them.
 
 Mygate has also started providing temperature checks and masks compliance. In pursuance of this, employers are frequently notified about the employees’ body temperature as well as whether the worker has worn a mask or not. In June 2020, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released a new set of guidelines for resuming offices. The [Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/1SoPstobefollowedinOffices.pdf) made it mandatory for people working in public services who were also classified as essential workers to use the Aarogya Setu application. Several government offices across India such as [Srinagar](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/government-employees-mandated-to-download-arogya-setu-app-in-srinagar/article31595219.ece) and [Puducherry](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-government-staff-says-puducherry-health-minister/article31566408.ece) were also mandated to install and use the app. The use of the app was not limited to the public sector. Around April 2020, online food delivery service companies such as [Grofers, Swiggy, and Zomato](https://m.economictimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/some-startups-mandate-aarogya-setu-others-remain-wary/articleshow/75339322.cms) had mandated their delivery agents to use the app. The apps also displayed the [temperature readings](https://www.medianama.com/2020/04/223-zomato-swiggy-temperature-check/) of the agents in addition to the people involved in preparing the food.
 
 
 The Indian labour laws [do not provide](http://www.nishithdesai.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdfs/The_Indian_legal_position_on_employee_data_protection_and_employee_privacy.pdf) for provisions that deal with employee monitoring and surveillance. Hence, the provisions that are to be consulted which address the issue of data protection and privacy is the [Information Technology (Amendment) Act](https://police.py.gov.in/Information%20Technology%20Act%202000%20-%202008%20(amendment).pdf), 2008 (hereinafter, “IT Act”) and the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) [Rules](https://www.prsindia.org/sites/default/files/bill_files/IT_Rules_2011.pdf), 2011 (hereinafter, “IT Rules”). Section 72A of the IT Act protects personal information from unlawful disclosure in breach of contract. In addition, Section 43A of the IT Act empowers the Central Government to stipulate the IT Rules which seek to provide individuals certain rights with regards to their information. This section also provides for the protection of sensitive personal data or information (hereinafter, “SPDI”).
 
 
In the latest post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series, we look at the privacy implications of the society and community management applications that resident associations are increasingly adopting in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities across India. We analyse the user rights from harm and consent-based frameworks, and how the upcoming data protection law may protect users.

- MyGate, Adda, Lockated, etc.
- While this idea may seem quite fascinating and convenient, several pressing issues arise including problems of workplace and peer surveillance along with potential function creep for the residents and visitors alike, of the society
- Applications such as [MyGate](https://mygate.com/blog/mygate-offerings/#datastorage) and [Adda](https://adda.io/blog/2018/05/adda-gdpr/) categorically claim to be compliant with the GDPR and the ISO 27001 security standards and have also stated that they use strong encryption while also having purpose limitations and data minimisation built-in. However, often the challenge that emerges from using these applications is not just that of data loss or breach, but rather of workplace and peer surveillance.
- In this way, the application also logs in their attendance and whether or not they went to a particular apartment for each day. This amounts to overbroad surveillance of house helps and violates their right to freedom of movement.
- Since the application requires the guests to furnish the name, contact details, and apartment number to be visited, these digital ledgers would be a prime target for neighbourhood and Resident Welfare Association busybodies as it would allow them to monitor the guests of each resident and may also result in unnecessary moral policing of residents, especially women.
- The draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 allows employers to process personal data of employees without their explicit consent, which means that despite having rights under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and the right to privacy having been declared a fundamental right by the Supreme Court, it can be overridden by the employers. Clause 13 of the draft Bill allows employers to process data that is not classified as sensitive personal data of the employees for recruitment, for provision of any service or benefit to the employee, for verification of their attendance and any other activity relating to the assessment of the performance of the employee. While non-sensitive personal data does not contain sensitive information such as biometric information, health data or address, it still has identifiable characteristics which can be linked together to profile an individual.
- While the proposed personal data protection bill, 2019 in Clause 11 calls for free, informed, clear and specific consent from data principals, the enforceability of it becomes blurred under the conditions and circumstances in which the domestic helps work. Another challenge that stems from the lack of free and informed consent is the absence to check and call for enforceability of the rights of the data principals. **The enforceability of ‘user rights’ under applications privacy policy is also murky as the domestic help themselves do not use the application - yet, are profiled by it**.
- These applications also allow the residents to ‘rate and review’ their domestic help claiming to help others in finding a better cook. This not only creates undue pressure on the help but would also mean that they have to comply with any additional requests of the residents in order to get better reviews. This way the application aims to create an unhealthy competition between the domestic help. This often leads to domestic helps complying with any data sharing that is requested from them - including additional identity proofs such as Aadhaar number, any proof of local contact, and in post-pandemic times, vaccination details. As a result, the ‘free’ nature of consent specified by Clause 11 may be further impinged upon.

### Recommendations
- 1.  **Compliance with the right to privacy decision:** In absence of a data protection regime, we recommend that the application maintain strict adherence to the test of necessity and proportionality as propounded by the Supreme Court in the right to privacy decision (Puttaswamy). Further, the principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13 of the Bill.
- 1.  **Amend Clause 13:** We recommend that it must be mandatory for employers to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
