# Goals

## Summary
A goal is an expectation of an end condition, whereas both activities and tasks are intermediate steps (at different levels of organization) that help someone to reach a goal or set of goals.

> Since goals are driven by human motivations, they change very slowlyâ€”if at allâ€”over time

ðŸ‘‰  **Goals are context dependent**
