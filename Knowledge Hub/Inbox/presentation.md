Hi Neeraj and again a very warm welcome to the team. I would like to take the opportunity to invite you to our bi-weekly meeting “UX Guild”. This meeting is intended for exchange and knowledge transfer and to share experiences. Everyone in the team is entitled and also called upon to present topics, present ideas or discuss current developments. It’s also an excellent platform for new team members to introduce themselves.
