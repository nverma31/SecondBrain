# Whats is the role of Design in the world

## Thought Process / Structure 
* Design is more than communication
* Design is intentional
* Every one designs
* But not everyone is a designer
* The idea of imagining future and anticipating the unintended consequenses that comes with that.


## Actual Piece

Design is more than just thin veneer on material things, intended to make them more attractive. Design is  intentional problem solving , not usually restricted to just material things, that fully takes into account the context and constraints.

A designer is someone who tries to understand the context -- People, resources, technology -- with best of thier abilities. Having a decent understanding of the context, he tries to envision a solution that solves an existing problem or strives for a better future. Understanding the context will always be incomplete, and that´s where the designer has to use his training and skill to deal with the uncertainities. However, the uncertainities should be made transparent

The rise of design as a mainstream profession can be attributed to the rise of capitalism over the last centuries. This can be confirmed again by looking at the the status or market share of design profession in developing nations. This, inturn would suggest that design is only necessary when we have achieved a certain prosperity. However, I would argue that that is just incidental, and design has a role to play in socities with varying level of prosperity. I would even go further in claiming that less prosperous societies need it even more as it has more constraints to work with.
