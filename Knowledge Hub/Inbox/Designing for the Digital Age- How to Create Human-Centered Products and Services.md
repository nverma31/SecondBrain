# Designing for the Digital Age- How to Create Human-Centered Products and Services
Date: Jan 3, 2022

## Summary

## Chapters

1. **Goal Directed Product and Service Design**
	1. [[Design]] is  the **craft** of **visualizing concrete solutions** that serve **human needs and goal**s within certain **constraints**.
	2. Some people refer to human-centered product and service design as [[experience design]], but I would argue that this term is presumptuous; we can design every aspect of the environment to encourage an optimal experience, but since each person brings her own attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions to any situation, no designer can determine exactly what experience someone has. For this reason, I refer to product and service design—or simply [[product design]], as a service is still the end product of the design .
	3. [[Interaction design]] Interaction design is a discipline focused on defining the form and behavior of interactive products, services, and systems.
	4. [[Goal Directed Design]] The Goal-Directed method is a set of tools and best practices developed entirely through practice in the real world.The method consists of four components: [[Design Principles]], [[Design Patterns]], [[Design Process]], and [[Design Practices]].
2. **Assembling the Team**:

	2. ![[Pasted image 20220105205848.png]]
	3. [[INTERACTION DESIGNERS]] require the ability to **visualise solutionsin concrete and visual terms**, and ability to think in terms of system flow. Since a key part of that system is human, it also requires an understanding of the goals and thought processes of typical humans who will use the system. **This combination of human understanding and flow is the story, or narrative, of the design.**
	4. [[Visual Interface Designer]]: She is responsible for articulating any visual design requirements, including a list of the product’s targeted brand attributes, which are essentially a description of its personality. From those attributes, the visual designer proposes a visual strategy, gets consensus on the direction, and develops and refines a detailed visual system, including color, typography, icons, and visual specifications for each component on the screen. In conjunction with the IxDS, the visual designer also documents this system.
	5. Industrial Designer
	6. [[Design team lead]]: 
		1. 1. The design team lead is a senior designer who, regardless of her specific discipline background, has had extensive exposure to the other disciplines.
		2.  The team lead is sufficiently involved to understand exactly what’s going on, but sufficiently distant to provide an objective assessment of design solutions.
		3.  There is no separation of business responsibility (such as scope and business relationship) and design responsibility.
	7. Design Engineer: One characteristic that distinguishes a design engineer from other engineers is a willingness to assume that nearly anything is possible. A design engineer responds to a technical challenge by saying, “Let me go try some things and get back to you.
3. **Project Planning**
	1. understand some fundamental issues:
		1. Are they focused on increasing revenue or on cutting costs?
		2. Do they want to innovate or just renovate? — Is the time horizon short or long?
		3. How well do they understand the problem, and do they have specific ideas about solving it?
		4.  How much are they willing to invest in a solution?
4. **Research Fundamentals**
5. **Understanding the Business**
	1.   Goal-Directed Design isn’t just about accomplishing user goals; a product or service that doesn’t also accomplish a business goal is a failure. Never shortchange your stakeholder research, even if it means compressing your time with potential users. Always:
		1. Identify the full range of stakeholders and meet with each — Take advantage of the expertise that’s available
		2. Learn about hopes, fears, beliefs, and goals — Avoid taking assumptions at face value
		3.  Remember that you’re not just asking questions—you’re also building essential relationships
	2. Once you have a solid understanding of the business, you’re ready to move on to research with potential customers and users.   
	3. [[Stakeholder Interviews]]
6. **Planning user Research**
	1. Identify likely roles.
	2. Begin with four users for narrowly defined roles, eight or 12 for broader ones.
	3.  Multiply by the number of factors you think will be most critical. — Divide by less critical factors.
	4. Trim if necessary, but allow for a couple of no-shows or poor interviews.
7.  **Understanding potential users Customers**
8. **Example Interview**
9. **Other Sources of Information and Inspiration** 
	1. Othe research methods
	2. Competitive Products and services
	3. Literature and Media
10. **Making sense of data: Modeling**
	1. 
11. **Personas**
12. **Defining Requirements**
	1. Problems with Requirements
		1. Requirements are not features. They cannot be *gathered* and [[Design Research]] help generate, filter, and prioritise requirements.
		2. Needs are so often combined with solutions.
	2. **Generating Effective Requirements**
		1. *Process Overview:*
			1. ![[Pasted image 20220301200254.png]]
		2. *Sources:* Design Research, Business objectives, external influences usch as regulatory agencies, competitors, and influential media. Good design principles, accessibility, etc.
		3. *Types:*
			1. **Data Needs:** Information that a user needs to consume. A list of data objects are nouns in the users mental model. the things they look for, read, or manipulate, such as e-mail messages, spreadsheets, or contacts. Attributes are either components or descriptors of each object
			2. **Functional Needs**: Verbs that describe what users should be able to do with or to those objects.
			3. **Product Qualities**: Brand guidelines, and everything important about a product and service.
			4. **Experience Attributes:** Communicates emotional qualities.
			5. **Constraints**: Time, cost, regulations
		4. *Process of generating requirements:* Two fundamental activities
			1. Analytics - Looking at requirements implied by various sources, then filtering them through personal goals.
			2. Generative - Creating scenarios that describe idealised product or service use, then drawing requirements from those.
		5. *Requirement Matrix* 
			1. ![[Pasted image 20220301200120.png]]
	3. **Scenarios**
		1. A *Scenario* is a plausible description of the future based on a coherent set of assumptions.
		2. A *Goal-Directed scenario* is a textual description of a persona’s interaction with the future product or service. Each scenario begins with a specific situation, then describes the interaction between persona and system from the beginning of a task or session through its completion. A scenario describes the actions of the persona and any system behaviors or actions evident to that persona, but does not describe any system behavior that’s invisible. Also, explains the persona’s motivations for particular behavior and indicates what persona goals the system’s behavior achieves.
		3. They differ from use cases(task not goal based) and user stories(usually requirements).
		4. *Context Scenarios* are early, high-level, and optimisitic, and focusing on ideal system behaviour. DO NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS.
			1. A context scenario begins with a triggering event and goes on to describe the sequence of information exchange, actions, and results
			2. *Characteristics of context Scenario:*
				1. Describes the future
				2. Presents personas point of view
				3. Is a story with a beginning and an end.
			3. *Creating a context Scenario*
				1. **Identify** what context scenarios you need. Nealry every product or service involves multiple context scenarios. Your context scenarios should include a typical example of each major activity your personas are likely to engage in.
				2. **Develop each story** by answering the most basic journalistic questions: who, what, where, when, why and how. Requires imaginaiton, empathy, design principles.
					1. Using the right level of detail
					2. Start with a Optimistic mind-set
					3. Stay true to personas
					4. Apply important [[Design Principles]]
					5. Make them compelling.
					6. REVIEW WITH OTHERS.
				3. **Communicating and extracting requirements from the scenarios**
					1. ![[Pasted image 20220301205332.png]]
					2. 
	4. **Other requirements from the Personas** 
		1. Mental models
		2. Environments
		3. Goals
		4. Physical and cognitive characteristics
		5. Skills and Knowledge
	5. **Requirements from Business and other needs**
		1. Customer persona goals
		2. *Stakeholders* are the only source for two types of requirements: what the product or service should accomplish for the business and how much time and money they’re willing to spend.
		3. *Experience Attributes:* The companies with the strongest brands understand that their products must not only make a good impression, but should also be visually identifiable as theirs.
			1. **Process** - compile desirable qualities from research, brand values ➡️ Cluster qualities ➡️ Refine and filter and choose best term for clusters ➡️ Optimise terms to guide visual decisions ➡️ Describe and optimise relationships.
			2. Expressing the experience attributes in visual terms helps stakeholders understand their relationship to the design.
		4. Competitors, regulations, and Media
13. **User and Domain Analysis: Putting it all together**
	1. Rhetorical Structure for presentation
		1. An introduction that includes the project parameters: Decribing project mandates and objectives, timeline, overall approach and contact information.
		2. A description of the research methods and activities and why you chose them Requirements
		3. A summary of findings that describe general issues and patterns — The set of personas that encapsulate those patterns
		4. Several scenarios describing how the personas would like things to be — The requirements implied by those scenarios and your findings
		5. A discussion of how you’ll move the process forward
