	1. Chapter 1 Usability of Interactive Systems 
		1. 1.1 Introduction 
			1. HCI being a multi-disciplinary field: experimental psychology to the tools of computer Science, designers, human factor experts, and now sociologists and Anthropologists, and finally policy wonks.

			1. The journal Ergonomics Abstracts oﬀers this classiﬁcation of human cognitive processes:
				1. Short-term and working memory

				4. Decision making and risk assessment 
				5. Language communication and comprehension

				7. Learning, skill development, knowledge acquisition, and concept attainment
			2. It also suggests this set of factors aﬀecting perceptual and motor performance:
				1. Arousal and vigilance Fatigue and sleep deprivation Perceptual (mental) load Knowledge of results and feedback Monotony and boredom Sensory deprivation Nutrition and diet Fear, anxiety, mood, and emotion Drugs, smoking, and alcohol Physiological rhythms

				2. Social Security, national identiﬁcation, and passport numbers Capitalization and punctuation Sorting sequences Icons, buttons, and colors Pluralization, grammar, and spelling 
				3. Etiquette, policies, tone, formality, and metaphors
