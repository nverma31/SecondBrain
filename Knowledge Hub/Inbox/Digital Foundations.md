# Digital Foundations
Traditional brand guidelines typically cover the do’s and don’ts of logo, colours, art direction, brand values, and tone of voice. They are applicable to everything a company does. Some companies might publish these guidelines in a ‘brand book’. Some companies produce a simple PDF.

Digital is different. The same principles we apply to physical spaces and print mediums don’t always work for digital, and there are some considerations that only affect digital. Factors like [[accessibility]] and **user experience** impact things like the colours we use (e.g. blue for navigation, red for errors, and green for success, etc.). There are other considerations such as **typography, animation, grids, responsive design, different platforms and operating systems, localisation, formatting, animation, load times**, etc. which are unique to the digital experience.

> Where a brand book typically comes in print or PDF forms, the ever changing nature of digital experiences requires a more — well — digital approach. Digital Foundations are better suited to a dynamic, accessible, and easily editable digital form. Some companies choose to make their digital brand guidelines public, and we’ll look at a few of those in a bit. Others are private — for employee eyes only.
