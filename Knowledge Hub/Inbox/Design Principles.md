# Design Principles
> While guidelines are low level, principles are more fundamental, widely-applicable, and enduring. Principles are guidelines for creating good solutions under specific circumstances.

## Determine user's Skill level
> A generic separation into novice or ﬁrst-time, knowledgeable intermittent, and expert frequent users might lead to these diﬀering design goal. Designing for one class of users is relatively easy; designing for several is much more diﬃcult. When multiple user classes must be accommodated, the basic strategy is to permit a _multi-layer_ (sometimes called level-structured or spiral) approach to learning.

1. Novice or first time users
2. Knowledgeable Interittent users
3. Expert frequent users

## Identify the Tasks 
>  High-level task actions can be decomposed into multiple middlelevel task actions, which can be further reﬁned into atomic actions


`ris:Information` Creating a matrix of users and tasks can help designers sort out these issues

## Choosing an Interaction Style
1. Direct Manipulation
2. Menu Selection
3. Form fill-in
4. Comand Language
5. Natural Language


## Eight Golden rules for Interaction Design

1. **Strive for consistency.** Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations; identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent color, layout, capitalization, fonts, and so on, should be employed throughout. Exceptions, such as required conﬁrmation of the delete command or no echoing of passwords, should be comprehensible and limited in number.

2. **Seek universal usability**. Recognize the needs of diverse users and design for plasticity, facilitating transformation of content. Novice to expert diﬀerences, age ranges, disabilities, international variations, and technological diversity each enrich the spectrum of requirements that guides design. Adding features for novices, such as explanations, and features for experts, such as shortcuts and faster pacing, enriches the interface design and improves perceived quality.

3. **Oﬀer informative feedback**. For every user action, there should be an interface feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, whereas for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial. Visual presentation of the objects of interest provides a convenient environment for showing changes explicitly (see the discussion of direct manipulation in Chapter 7 ). 4. Design dialogs to yield closure. Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives users the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions. For example, e-commerce websites move users from selecting products to the checkout, ending with a clear conﬁrmation page that completes the transaction.

5. **Prevent errors.** As much as possible, design the interface so that users cannot make serious errors; for example, gray out menu items that are not appropriate and do not allow alphabetic characters in numeric entry ﬁelds (Section 3.3.5 ). If users make an error, the interface should oﬀer simple, constructive, and speciﬁc instructions for recovery. For example, users should not have to retype an entire nameaddress form if they enter an invalid zip code but rather should be guided to repair only the faulty part. Erroneous actions should leave the interface state unchanged, or the interface should give instructions about restoring the state.

6. **Permit easy reversal of actions**. As much as possible, actions should be reversible. This feature relieves anxiety, since users know that errors can be undone, and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data-entry task, or a complete group of actions, such as entry of a name-address block.

7. **Keep users in control while increasing Automation.** Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions. They don’t want surprises or changes in familiar behavior, and they are annoyed by tedious data-entry sequences, diﬃculty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desired result.

8. **Reduce short-term memory load.** Humans’ limited capacity for information processing in short-term memory (the rule of thumb is that people can remember “seven plus or minus two chunks” of information) requires that designers avoid interfaces in which users must remember information from one display and then use that information on another display. It means that cellphones should not require reentry of phone numbers, website locations should remain visible, and lengthy forms should be compacted to ﬁt a single display.
