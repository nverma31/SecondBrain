## Regulating yGate   
The new Minister for Electronics and Information Technology has requested a meeting with you  next month to get your view on a topic his department is currently deliberating upon. She has heard  of your recent graduation from Takshashila, specialising in technology & policy and wishes to sound  you out before considering her next steps.   

It has been brought to the governmentâ€™s notice that a growing number of apartment complexes and  housing societies are adopting apps like yGate to facilitate entry and exit of residents, guests and  trades-people in their premises. Initially offered as a convenient way to ensure basic security, the  apps now offer a wide range of services relating to the **management and administration of [[ apartment communities]]**. In addition, they integrate with other third-party services like home  delivery, home medical services, domestic services, real-estate agencies, CCTV, discussion groups  etc.   
Usually, companies like **yGate strike deals with Resident Welfare Associations/Apartment Owners Associations** . While such organisations are expected to operate within the [[ByeLaws, and the relevant  government acts]], in practice, their governance standards vary widely.  Meanwhile, Supreme Court judgements and influential civil society voices have raised **concerns on  privacy and data protection.** In the context of individuals living in apartment complexes, the  situation appears to be murky as lines of responsibility, accountability and liability are very unclear.   

The Minister has asked you to analyse the situation and offer preliminary recommendations on **how  companies such as yGate ought to be governed**. You must consider the various **[[stakeholders]]** and  their interests and reconcile these with the larger public interest and relevant laws and norms to  have a forward-looking governance framework.   

**Requirements**:  Using the concepts, frameworks and techniques you have learnt over the past 12 weeks, create a  SlideDoc of no more than 20 slides, including your analysis of the situation and suggesting  recommendations. Your SlideDoc must be uploaded to Shala in PDF format by Tuesday, 21  December.
