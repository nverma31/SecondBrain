## 👉 Read better - Mortimer Adler

### I. Inspectional Reading

🧭 **Systematic skimming** — This is meant to be a quick check of the book by (1) reading the preface; (2) studying the table of contents; (3) checking the index; and (4) reading the inside jacket. This should give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in the book, pivotal to the author’s argument. Dip in here and there, but never with more than a paragraph or two. Skimming helps you reach to a decision point: Does this book deserve more of my time and attention? If not, you put it down.

🤷‍♀️ **Superficial reading** — This is when you just read. Don’t ponder the argument, don’t look things up, don’t write in the margins. If you don’t understand something, move on. What you gain from this quick read will help you later when you go back and put more effort into reading. You now come to another decision point. Now that you have a better understanding of the book’s contents and its structure, do you want to understand it?

### II. Analytical Reading

### Stage 1

💡 It allows the reader to answer the question — _"What is this book about as a whole?"_



In other words, you understand the theme of the book and how the author builds that theme via the constituting sub-themes and chapters

The First Stage of Analytical Reading, or Rules for Finding What a Book Is About:

1.  Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
    
2.  State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
    
3.  Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.
    
4.  Define the **problem or problems** the author is trying to solve.
    

### Stage 2

💡 It allows the reader to answer the question — _"What is being said in detail, and how?"_



The Second Stage of Analytical Reading, or Rules for Finding What a Book Says (Interpreting Its Contents):

5.  Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.
    
6.  Grasp the **author's leading propositions** by dealing with his most important sentences.
    
7.  Know the **author's arguments**, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.
    
8.  Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.
    

### Stage 3

💡 It is about having a conversation with the Author and in other words, criticizing the book as a communication of knowledge



**A. General Maxims of Intellectual etiquette**

9.  Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say "I understand.")
    
10.  Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.
    
11.  Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make.
    

**B. Special Criteria for Points of Criticism**

12.  Show wherein the author is uninformed.
    
13.  Show wherein the author is misinformed.
    
14.  Show wherein the author is illogical.
    
15.  Show wherein the author's analysis or account is incomplete.
    

### III. Syntopical Reading

> _The goal is not to achieve an overall understanding of any particular book, but rather to understand the subject and develop a deep fluency._

There are five steps to syntopical reading:

1.  Finding the Relevant Passages — You need to _find the right books_ and then the passages that are most relevant to filling your needs. So the first step is an inspectional reading of all the works that you have identified as relevant.
2.  Bringing the Author to Terms — In analytical reading, you must identify the keywords and how they are used by the author. This is fairly straightforward. The process becomes more complicated now as each author has probably used different terms and concepts to frame their argument. Now the onus is on you to establish the terms. Rather than using the author’s language, you must use your own. In short, this is an exercise in translation and synthesis.
3.  Getting the Questions Clear — Rather than focus on the problems the author is trying to solve, you need to focus on the questions that you want answered. Just as we must establish our own terminology, so too must we establish our own propositions by shedding light on our problems to which the authors provide answers. It’s important to frame the questions in such a way that all or most of the authors can be interpreted as providing answers. Sometimes we might not get an answer to our questions because they might not have been seen as questions by the authors.
4.  Defining the Issues — If you’ve asked a clear question to which there are multiple answers then an issue has been defined. Opposing answers, now translated into your terms, must be ordered in relation to one another. Understanding multiple perspectives within an issue helps you [form an intelligent opinion](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/).
5.  Analyzing the Discussion — It’s presumptuous to expect we’ll find a single unchallenged truth to any of our questions. Our answer is the conflict of opposing answers. The value is the discussion you have with these authors. You can now have an informed opinion.

## 👉 What to read

-   Read books that are challenging and you can have a conversation with the Author.
-   Find the classics in that subject and move on to the contemporary stuff

> _Read good books that are over my head. Mind is like any other muscle; more you stretch it more it will grow._

## 👉 Take better Notes

💡 Sometimes, when you are reading original classics, you may have to start with an inspectional superficial reading and then move on to the note taking.



### First reading

1.  The first thing I do when I pick up a book is read the preface, the table of contents, and the inside jacket
2.  While reading, I take notes. I circle words I need to look up. I star points that I think are critical to the argument. I underline anything that strikes me as interesting. I comment like a madman in the margins. I try to tease out assumptions, etc.

 💡 You are basically following the rules of analytical reading while taking the notes.


1.  At the end of each chapter, I write a few bullet points that summarize what I’ve just read. When I’m done, I write a brief summary of the entire book and then I do something few other people do. I let the book age.

### Afterwards

1.  Pick up the book again and go through all your notes. Most of these will be garbage but there will be lots you want to remember. Write the good stuff on the inside cover of the book along with a page number. Sometimes, and this depends on the book, I’ll create a sort of mental summary of the book’s main arguments and gaps. Sometimes I’ll cross-link points with other books.
2.  (Optional) Copy out the excerpts by hand or take a picture of them to pop into Evernote. Tag accordingly.

[The Top 3 Most Effective Ways to Take Notes While Reading](https://fs.blog/2013/11/taking-notes-while-reading/)

## 👉 How to remember most details

1.  Active reading
2.  Read classics and be prepared to Re-read
3.  Prepare for the reading
4.  Know why are you reading - THE GOAL
5.  Stay Focused
6.  Mark up the book
7.  **Build a vivid mental picture** - _Building vivid mental pictures is one of the most effective techniques for remembering anything, not least what we read. When you come across an important passage or concept, pause and visualize it. Make the picture as salient and distinctive as possible._
8.  Make Mental Links - _"Books do not exist in a vacuum. Every concept or fact can be linked to countless others."_
9.  Keep mental models in mind
    1.  basically this translate to different lenses you have when you are thinking about a topic. For instance, global warming can be thought through the lens of economy, ecology, biology, geology, sociology, IR etc,
    2.  Have as much of these lenses as possible
    3.  👉 But overcome your biases and be open as much as possible - Don't pigeon-hole yourself.
10.  Stop when you are bored.
11.  Make notes and make them searchable

### The learning process

> _The basic process of learning consists of reflection and feedback. We learn ideas gained through experiences – ours or others – that remain unchallenged unless we make the time to reflect on them. If you read something and you don’t make time to think about what you’ve read, your conclusions will be shaky._

**Apply what you have learned**

-   So, you’ve finished the book. Now what? How can you use what you have learned? Don’t just go away with a vague sense of “oh yeah, I should totally do what that author says.” Take the time to make a plan and decide how to implement key lessons from the book.

**The Feynman Technique**

You can think of it as an algorithm for guaranteed learning. There are four simple steps: choose a concept; teach it to a toddler; identify gaps and go back to the source material; and review and simplify.

If there is no one around who is interested, try talking to yourself. That’s what I do … but maybe I’m crazy.

## 🤩 The blank Sheet

But the most effective approach that we’ve found, and tested on thousands of people, is called the blank sheet. It’s the single easiest change you can make to reading that will 10x your ability to recall what you’re reading.

Here’s how it works:

1.  Before you start reading a new book, take out a blank sheet of paper.
2.  Write down what you know about the subject you’re about to read — a mind map if you will.
3.  After you are done a reading session spend a few minutes adding to the map (we use a different color ink).Before you start your next reading session, review the mindmap (we use ours as a bookmark sometimes.)
4.  Put these mind maps into a binder that you periodically review.

Works like a charm.
