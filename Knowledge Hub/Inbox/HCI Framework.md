# Design Frameworks

> The concept of design frameworks captures this idea: the speciﬁc ﬂavor and approach the design takes to conducting the design process. 


- [ ] Differentiate between user-centred Design to the Agole interaction Design
## User Centred Design

1. User-centered design (UCD) is a counterpoint to this fallacy and prescribes a design process that primarily takes the needs, wants, and limitations of the actual end users into account during each phase of the design process (Lowdermilk, 2013). Directly involving the intended users in the process constantly challenges the assumptions of the design team about user behavior in the real world and gives designers a much-needed understanding of what their users actually need.
2. While the main premise of UCD—user involvement—is straightforward, it is also its most signiﬁcant challenge.


##  Participatory Design
1. Going beyond user-centered design, participatory design (PD) (also known as cooperative design in Scandinavia) is the direct involvement of people in the collaborative design of the things and technologies they use. The arguments in favor suggest that more user involvement brings more accurate information about tasks and an opportunity for users to inﬂuence design decisions. The sense of participation that builds users’ ego investment in successful implementation may be the biggest inﬂuence on increased user acceptance of the ﬁnal system (Kujala, 2003; Muller and Druin, 2012). 
2. On the other hand, extensive user involvement may be costly and may lengthen the implementation period. It may also generate antagonism from people who are not involved or whose suggestions are rejected and potentially force designers to compromise their designs to satisfy incompetent participants.

## Agile Interaction Design
1. Thus, agile interaction design uses lightweight design processes that facilitate the incremental and iterative nature of agile software developments.
2. agile interaction design will use sketches, low-ﬁdelity mockups, and fast usability inspections
