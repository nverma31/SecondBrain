### How it works
1. [Download the Voi app](https://app.adjust.com/48s7k5x?campaign=how_to_voi&adgroup=UK) and register with your mobile number.  
2. Locate an available scooter nearby using the map function in the app.  
3. Activate Beginner’s mode if you’re new to e-scooters, to start off slowly while you get used to the accelerator and brakes.  
4. Scan the QR code found on the handlebar or the footpad of the scooter to unlock it.  
5. Hop on the scooter and push off with your foot a few times to get it rolling before you use the throttle.  
6. End your ride in the app to make the scooter available for someone else.\
7. Take the photo and rate the ride.
