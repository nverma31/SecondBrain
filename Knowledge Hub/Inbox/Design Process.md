# Design process


One way to deﬁne design is by its operational characteristics (Rosson and Carroll, 2002):
1. **Design is a process;** it is not a state, and it cannot be adequately represented statically.
2. **The design process is nonhierarchical**; it is neither strictly bottom-up nor strictly top-down.
3. **The process is radically transformational**; it involves the development of partial and interim solutions that may ultimately play no role in the ﬁnal design.
4. **Design intrinsically involves the discovery of new goals.**

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis
> Makes sense to write the requirements as [[Use Cases]]

1. **Functional requirements** deﬁne speciﬁc behavior that the system should support (often captured in so-called use cases, see below); 
2. **Non-functional requirements** specify overall criteria governing the operation of the interactive system without being tied to a speciﬁc action or behavior (hardware, software, system performance, reliability, etc.); 
3. **User experience requirements** explicitly specify non-functional requirements for the user interaction and user interface of the interactive system (navigation, input, colors, etc.).

### Phase 2: Preliminary and Detailed Design 
1. The preliminary design is also known as architectural design, and in engineering settings this stage often entails deriving the architecture of the system. For user experience and interaction design, preliminary design consists of mapping out the high-level concepts such as the user, controls, interface displays, navigation mechanisms, and overall workﬂow. Preliminary design can also be called conceptual design.
2. Suitable [[Design Methods]] for the design phase should thus go beyond eliciting the needs of the users and instead ﬁnd ways to fulﬁll these needs.

### Phase 3: Build and Implementation
Differentiate between:
1. Mobile
2. Web
3. Desktop

### Phase 4: Evaluation
