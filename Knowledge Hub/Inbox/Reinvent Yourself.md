# Reinvent Yourself


1. Refuse to let your degree define you, find [[mentors]] to help you redefine yourself.
2. Practice your passion everyday, and find it thinking back on your childhood.
3. Your burning desire will enable you to overcome obstacles and conquer your fear of failure.
4. We should strive to help others with their pain and channel our own sufferings into our passion
5. Without determination, talent can only take you so far, and being broke drive you forward.
6. Remember your values and make growth-oriented decisions
7. Success comes from long-term systems rather than short-term goals


### Summary
To succeed in the fat-paced world, we must master the art of reinventing ourselves in order to navigate our way through the ever-shifting seas of the modern world and reach the shores of success.
