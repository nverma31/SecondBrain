09:22 - Participant transcription

09:28 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-568.44-1-569.0000000000001

09:36 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-576.34-0-589.06

Sometimes I take a scooter if I'm really late but sometimes I got to also take the bus and if I have time I can also walk as well but it depends on the weather and things.

09:39 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-579.44-1-579.86

Mhm.

09:46 - Moderator transcription

Okay.

09:48 - Moderator transcription

Mhm.

09:50 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-590.04-1-590.37

Okay.

09:50 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-590.38-1-592.36

So you mentioned you take the train also?

09:52 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-592.36-1-597.45

Right, So where do you go for, what are the different reasons you take the train for vertical?

09:58 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-598.54-0-605.35

Um The only reason that I would like to take the train is because it's so hard to find a parking spot.

10:05 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-605.94-0-610.05

And then in the city center it depends on where I need to go to.

10:06 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-606.04-1-606.55

Mhm.

10:10 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-610.54-0-615.78

So even if I have a rented car, you know, it's also such a hustle.

10:10 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-610.64-1-611.26

Mhm.

10:13 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-613.94-1-614.1300000000001

Okay.

10:15 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-615.78-0-620.05

Especially during the rush hours to find a parking spot.

10:20 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-620.54-0-628.55

It could even take me, you know, sometimes even half an hour I would need to drive a completely different route because I can't find a parking spot.

10:29 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-629.0399999999998-0-640.45

And so it's really a problem for me that's why sometimes when I really go to the clients that is inside the city center, sometimes it's easier for me to take the trade.

10:29 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-629.34-1-629.85

Okay.

10:33 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-633.04-1-641.35

Mhm, mm hmm, mm hmm.

10:40 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-640.4600000000002-0-650.3500000000001

So just because of the parking, some mixed streets really don't have the options to park close by where I need to go to.

10:43 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-643.7400000000001-1-644.66

Okay.

10:48 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-648.34-1-651.66

Mhm, mm hmm.

10:50 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-650.84-0-667.5800000000002

So yeah I either to be honest if I really have to go inside the city center except for when there's a big park house nearby.

10:52 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-652.0399999999998-1-658.15

Okay, so sometimes you'll take the train, sometimes they'll help you, they'll rent the card assistant?

11:05 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-665.84-1-666.46

Mhm.

11:07 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-667.59-0-671.8600000000001

So when when the place is really big it has a powerhouse then it's good.

11:11 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-671.8400000000001-1-672.05

11:12 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-672.54-0-677.1599999999999

But if it's a client that is like on a big street with no house nearby.

11:17 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-677.6399999999999-0-680.45

11:26 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-686.67-0-694.51

So um if it is a mixed street, just a commercial street with no park house and then it's really busy.

11:32 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-692.4400000000002-1-706.86

11:34 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-694.51-0-701.3600000000001

I mean sometimes I need to drive for like 15 minutes away and have to walk back to the place.

11:42 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-702.3400000000001-0-705.96

11:45 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-705.9700000000001-0-709.8600000000001

12:02 - Participant transcription

20:57 - Participant transcription

Okay.

21:14 - Moderator transcription

So you mentioned you have used the scooter?

21:18 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1278.49-1-1281.4

21:18 - Participant transcription

Right.

21:21 - Moderator transcription

Mhm.

21:24 - Participant transcription

I use a e bike.

21:25 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1285.04-1-1297.56

So, Mhm, mm hmm.

21:27 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1287.64-0-1296.46

I have a little bit of worries about scooters because you know bicycle and scooters then you can write on the on the pavement.

21:36 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1296.84-0-1316.39

But if you really use a scooter that is like an electric vehicle then you have to um drive on the on the street and I don't know if you know the street here in Germany or not um you're driving next to the cars and sometimes I don't really feel safe doing it that way.

21:49 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1309.04-1-1309.36

Mhm.

21:53 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1313.44-1-1313.85

Yeah.

21:56 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1316.4-0-1323.66

So if possible I try to find an e bike so that I can still ride on the pavement.

22:02 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1322.84-1-1324.66

Right, Okay.

22:05 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1325.039999999999-1-1333.17

So, as you said, due to do the streets in Munich have like bike only lanes?

22:13 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1333.24-0-1334.98

Yes, a lot of them.

22:15 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1335.02-0-1343.05

And then even if they don't have a bike only area, you can still ride on the pavement, No one says anything.

22:23 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1343.06-0-1345.36

I don't know if you legally can do that.

22:23 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1343.84-1-1349.849999999999

Okay, mm hmm.

22:25 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1345.37-0-1355.06

But you know, I've always been writing on the pavement so so because if you have a more path then you cannot write on the pavement.

22:33 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1353.44-1-1354.16

Mhm.

22:35 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1355.54-0-1361.7

But if you have the other things you can mingle in with the other people writing around on the pavement.

22:35 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1355.94-1-1356.45

Nothing.

22:41 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1361.7-0-1373.1

So it's quite feeling safer for me because those things sometimes move, I mean not that quick, like a car, but you don't feel protected like being in a car.

22:49 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1369.14-1-1369.46

Mhm.

22:51 - Moderator transcription

Mhm.

22:53 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1373.11-0-1385

And then sometimes, yeah, sometimes when you don't really know all the functions are not that familiar with the functions and then it's a little bit, takes a little bit of time to get used to the vehicle.

23:05 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1385.01-0-1393.56

So it's always feeling safer for me to not have to drive along with the cars on the street.

23:14 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1394.44-1-1395.22

Okay.

23:15 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1395.23-1-1402.77

And when you're riding an e bike or a scooter, do you have to use any helmet?

23:19 - Participant transcription

Okay.

23:28 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1408.77-1-1414.86

So when you use the bike, uh, the e bike or a scooter, do you have to use a helmet?

23:37 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1417.14-0-1426.85

I do use a map, google maps, ham it No, no, no, no, no Hammett, No, no Hammett.

23:40 - Moderator transcription

23:45 - Moderator transcription

Okay.

23:46 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1426.85-0-1428

That's the downside of it.

23:48 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1428.01-0-1433.27

So yeah, the more pet you get you get a ham it inside of the trunk.

23:48 - Moderator transcription

Mhm.

23:53 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1433.28-0-1436.55

But the scooter and even if you don't get a Hammett.

23:53 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1433.74-1-1437.85

Mhm, yep.

23:57 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1437.14-0-1441.71

But anyway, the compensation for that is that you get to write on the pavement.

24:01 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-1441.72-0-1444.49

So it feels a little bit, I don't know.

24:26 - Moderator transcription

24:30 - Moderator transcription

Yeah.

24:34 - Participant transcription

24:37 - Participant transcription

24:44 - Participant transcription

So you can't you can't really take over the car and if you take over the car you get to swift into the next lane.

24:53 - Participant transcription

24:56 - Participant transcription

47:06 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2826.58-0-2829.34

And then why is it like that?

47:09 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2829.34-0-2833.2

They don't really have anything here or is it a wrong navigation system?

47:16 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2836.78-1-2845.98

So let's say in this case uh as you said, the closest one is 1.6 or 1.7 km, right?

47:24 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2844.48-0-2844.889999999999

47:26 - Moderator transcription

47:30 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2850.68-1-2854.61

47:32 - Participant transcription

47:34 - Moderator transcription

47:39 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2859.88-0-2864.8

If I'm on my own then I'll consider I will take a year scooter.

47:45 - Moderator transcription

47:49 - Moderator transcription

Yeah I still need to get there.

47:58 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2878.08-0-2891

But it's not the most convenient if I have the options, I wouldn't go that far with the kids because I have to push the kinder wagon and then I have to pack everything in the wagon into the car.

47:58 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2878.28-1-2878.7

48:03 - Moderator transcription

48:18 - Moderator transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-2898.369999999999-1-2904.4

48:23 - Participant transcription

01:01:47 - Participant transcription

01:02:00 - Participant transcription
Link: https://lookback.io/play/fgTEBPBYhsSkYx6D4#flow-3720.8-0-3743.07

Well I think in terms of functionality there are some small things that you can improve already said terms of experience um in terms of, I don't know whether it's an availability kind of thing, but why would like, I mean at least five now and share now is showing some cars that is in my area.

01:02:23 - Participant transcription

I don't know if it is like that, if it is that you don't have anything in my area or to just have a problem showing stuff in my area if you can see, I mean I'm sure there are stuff on this side so, but why would why is there only areas like why am I being put on an area that is like two km away from me.
