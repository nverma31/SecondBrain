# Miscellaneous Thoughts
- Linking writing based on Iris murdoch interview that literature has certain formal properties which links to the "form" property in philosophy of Art.

- Expanding on this idea, if I can master the sentence and learn the formal aspects of literature- I can become an excellent writer.

- Writing is problem solving as well. If I get into the habit of writing I can identify different problems which I can categorise and document which will help me in becoming a good writer.
