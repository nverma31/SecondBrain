        -   Another one from Curtis McHale, but this one is specifically a good introduction and demonstration of how connecting notes works.

    -   [Justin’s Obsidian Setup July 2020 – Effective Remote Work – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jJBUJoCWiE)

    -   [GitHub – mm53bar/obsidian_utils: Various scripts and utilities for Obsidian.md](https://github.com/mm53bar/obsidian_utils)

    -   [dotfiles/agenda at master · blay/dotfiles · GitHub](https://github.com/blay/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/agenda)
        -   Not specifically for Obsidian, but works well with it, this script compiles an agenda from a specifically formatted collection of markdown files. A good starting point for making your own.
